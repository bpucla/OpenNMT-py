There is one . 5 blocks away from here ?
Surely , of course . What kind of currency have you got ?
How much would you like to change ?
This is Mr Meng speaking , Michelle .
That was quick ! I wasn't expecting it until later this week .
Shall I come in and collect it ?
Mmmm ... if I come in and collect it this afternoon , is there any way I could use it today ? Petty cash is getting low , so I need to draw some money .
I see . Yes , that's fine . I'll be there at around 2:30 pm . See you later , and thanks .
As a reporter , he must have acute insight and language skills . At the same time , he must have good judgment , the respect for his job and tactical cooperation with others .
I think I've got used to work under pressure . I will adjust myself to the step of your newspaper quickly .
Good morning I'd like to mail this box of books to Taiwan .
How long does it take to reach Taiwan by sea ?
That's too long.How long does it take to reach Taiwan by airmail ?
Then how much is that by airmail ?
That's a little bit expensive .
I guess I have to send it by airmail .
Yes , please .
OK .
Of course . Go straight ahead . Turn right at the next street . You'll see a tall , yellow building.The post office is on the first floor .
Yes , you are right .
No , It's only about five minutes ' walk .
It's my pleasure .
He's a bright boy , isn't he ?
Don't worry , he'll make good progress step by step .
What is that problem , sir ?
Are you sure , sir ? Flies I could believe , but cockroaches ?
Sir , we run a spotless and cockroach-less hotel .
I'm sorry , sir . Let me transfer you to my supervisor .
Why not ? It's my parking space .
Oh ? That's a surprise . Let me see ... D 0411 Our dog's birthday . Yes , I'm sure this my parking space !
Oh , we've just repainted our car . It was red .
Yeah . It used to . We got that fixed yesterday too .
Sure , go ahead .
That's all right . It's not your fault .
I need to buy a new refrigerator today .
I like that Kenmore refrigerator .
Tell me about it .
What are the appliances .
I'd like to see it for myself .
I like what I see .
So what about the tennis racket ?
How much did that end up costing you ?
Hey , two for one . That's a super deal .
I'm looking for someone who works here , but I lost his business card . His name's Long or Sang or something like that .
Yeah , that sounds right .
Let me think ... accounting , finance , something like that .
That's him !
I appreciate your help .
Here's my card .
Yes , that's right . We want as much info as possible before we agree to anything .
So , do you think our corporation will be eligible for this ?
Just a minute . I ’ m putting on my clothes .
Yes . Oh , dear , I can ’ t find my hairbrushes . Can you help me ?
I put it in the dressing room .
Yes , quite sure .
Yes , I ’ Ve looked everywhere downstairs .
Where ?
I am just waiting for my friends . It won't be long .
But I didn't see the sign , Ma ’ am .
I didn't see it .
Yes , I am . I always make a plan before I do anything .
I don't want to have a specific title . I just want to enjoy what I am doing .
It's the most important thing to me .
That obviously depends on how things go - - whether I'm suited to the firm and the firm to me .
I want to put my knowledge and experience to use in a challenging position . In order to achieve this goal , I just want to work step by step .
I haven't thought it over at all .
I think the most important thing is the interest in the job .
Certainly . May I see your social security and your ID , please .
Oh , current accounts don't pay out interest .
It's primarily designed for business transactions . That is , writing checks to pay for bills , buying things and sending money . We won't expect a large amount of deposit in a current account .
Good morning , Steven .
It'll be a national campaign starting next week .
I suggest that we focus on slice of life , showing how you can beat the summer heat by biting into a cool ice-cream sandwich .
Definitely .
That's fine . You must try this dish .
It's fish steamed and served with our special sauce .
Sure . It's a most popular dish .
We have two dressings for salad . Which one would you like ?
We have French and Thousand Island .
Where will you go , sir ?
OK , it's not far from here .
Sure , I'll try my best . Here we are .
The reading on the meter is 15 yuan .
Thank you very much .
Hi , Cindy . It ’ s Michael Kurt . Is Mr . Johnson in ?
Yeah , that ’ ll be great . I ’ m on extension 4283 .
Hi , Bill . I ’ d like to take the apartment I looked at yesterday .
So , what do we do now ?
Okay . ( Reads the lease ) So , according to the lease , I ’ ll deposit one month ’ s rent as a security deposit , and I have to pay the first month ’ s rent in advance . I understand that I ’ ll get the security deposit back when I move out if the apartment does not need any costly repairs .
Can I pay you by check ?
Is there a laundry room in the basement ?
Can I sign the lease right now ?
I'm thinking of travelling to Suzhou in July . Could you recommend some tourist programs for that ?
How much does a six-day tour by train cost ?
Does that include hotels and meals ?
That sounds reasonable . What about the five-day flying journey ? How much is that ?
Covering all expenses ?
Of course not . I'm just observing casual day . On Fridays , the company doesn't require us to wear formal business attire .
We don't think so . Casual days are becoming more common , and we believe employees can maintain a professional image without wearing uncomfortable clothes .
Not really . Besides , there is a separate dress code for casual day . People can't just wear whatever they want .
Believe it or not , it has the opposite effect . Employees are actually more productive on casual days .
Hello , Lucy , this is Monica . I ’ m calling for the accountant position . I saw the information about the vacancy on your company ’ s website . Is it still available ?
No , not yet . First , I want to check about the availability and see if you could give more information .
The notification period of my current job is not that long and I ’ m quite profession to English and I am happy with the traveling abroad as I ’ m good dealing with the people from other cultures . It makes the whole job even more interesting . I will send my resume to you still this week .
Yes , do you have any rooms available ?
No . I need a double and three triples . My family is waiting for me in the car .
Ok ... Here you are .
Is breakfast included ?
I stayed home because I wasn't feeling well .
My stomach was bothering me .
I'm still feeling a little sick .
I'd appreciate that .
Including my keys ?
All right . What shall I do now ?
I've got film in my bag .
That's fine .
Sure . Here you are .
Am I through now ?
Thank you and goodbye .
I ’ d like extra prints made of these photos .
Yes.Here they are . I ’ Ve marked how many prints I want on each shot .
Four by six , except this one . I want a ten by thirteen print of this one .
I'm interested in taking a tour to Sydney .
How much does it cost ?
Does that include the insurance ?
Like wise . Take a seat , please . How about a cup of tea ?
Yes , it's not too bad . Our sales are going up year after year . And we still have a large potential production capacity .
That's a good idea . So far , we have several agents abroad .
That sounds good .
Usually , we give a commission of 4 % to our agents .
Don't worry . We'll allow you a higher commission rate if your sales score a substantial increase .
It sounds OK . Then how do you pay the commission ?
All right . If it's okay , we would like to sign an agency agreement with you immediately .
Thank you for your help .
I'm sorry . These batteries are not on sale .
I'm sorry . If you look at the ad again , you'll see that the other brand is on sale .
Yes , many people make that mistake .
You're right . Many ads are like that .
Just one second , and I'll give you the batteries that are on sale .
I don't have a girlfriend . I'm single .
No , I like being single . I never thought lonely , I'm focus on my career . Maybe I'll start to look for my girl when I achieve success .
Because I'm living a real world , a man enriched have a good career and make a lot of money . Franklin speaking the girls I've met wounldn't married a man wounldn't make enough money .
Yeah , I ’ Ve been meaning to talk to you about that . I might need to ask for an extension on that deadline .
Well , the thing is , we ran into a lot of problems . . .
I know , and I apologize for the delay . But some things were just beyond my control . I had trouble booking the photographer , and then Michael was sick for three weeks , so I couldn ’ t include him in the photos , and the design team lost all the files , so I had to re-do the pictures .
Can I have Mr . J . Smith paged ? He said he'd be in the main dining room . I'm Mr . J . B . White .
Mr . J . Smith .
To the front desk .
That ’ s what I am here for . What questions can I answer for you ?
The best product is Techne , and you can buy either the lotion or cream .
The cream form is very popular .
You could also take an antihistamine to help the rash go away quicker .
Anytime you have a question , please feel free to ask .
Yes . What's the problem ?
Oh , I am very sorry about that . It's our fault . I will arrange someone to correct it immediately .
Anyway , we apologize for the inconvenience we have brought you . Please just wait for a moment , and it will be fixed .
Whose name did you pick ?
Booze !
No , the steak was recommended , but it is not very fresh .
This is very annoying .
No , I don't risk it .
I'm not keen on dessert as a habit . They are fattening .
No , I'm Mary .
No , I'm in Class There .
There's an airsickness bag behind the seat that's in front of you .
Is this your first time flying ?
Oh , it's a beautiful city . I think you'll like it .
Sometimes if you don't think about it , that sick feeling will go away on its own .
I'm Frank . Nice to meet you .
Hi ! Let me get a dozen croissants , four blueberry muffins and a loaf of sourdough bread .
No , that's OK . Do you have any whole wheat bread ?
Sure that sounds good . Do you have any cakes ?
I'll just take a cheesecake .
Yes .
Thank you , Mr . Jackson , ladies and gentlemen , colleagues , friends . The subject of my talk is international relations in a morgen world . I plan to say a few words about the current situation in the Middle East and how it affects world economy . I'd like to give you an overview of the way that the economies of seemingly unrelated countries are intertwined . I've divided my talk into three parts , first an overview of international relations , second a discussion of current political situations , and lastly trends for the future . My presentation will take about two hours , but there will be a twenty-minute break in the middle . We'll stop for lunch at 12 .
I couldn't sleep well recently .
I always drink too much wine in the evening .
Yes , you are right .
Many thanks for your advice .
Hello Dr Peters . Just fine thank you . Ricky and I are here for his vaccines .
What about Rubella and Mumps ?
OK , great . Doctor , I think I also may need a Tetanus booster . Last time I got it was maybe fifteen years ago !
Great . Are you a qualified teacher ?
What kind of teaching certificate do you have ?
How many years of experience do you have ?
When did you get your TEFL certificate ?
Why do you want to teach at our school ?
That ’ s great . Can you speak Chinese ?
Can you come in for an interview tomorrow at 10:00 ?
Great . See you then .
What's going on ?
More and more people easily get irritated while driving .
That ’ s great . What are the prizes ?
To encourage the staff increases .
What about the afternoon ?
Ah , hello . I'm calling to find out how I apply for a car loan .
Yes , I do . It's ready and waiting in my account .
Could I just stop you there ? Sorry to interrupt , but I have already been to your appointed dealer and selected the car I want .
Yes , it's 110,000 RIB . So , with the down payment done , I will need to borrow 70,000 RIB .
Yes , I have everything here . OK , I'll come in and see you later today . Maybe I could have my new car as early as next week ! How exciting !
Tom , the new sales representative ? Nice to meet you ! I'm Melinda .
Now let me show you around . This is our reception area , and our conference room is right over there . Over here is the sales department .
Yeah ... You can make photocopies and send faxes over there .
I tell you what just between you and me , we just mess things up so that it looks like we work hard.Just kidding . Oh , your cubicle is over the . And this way . Those are all private offices the managers offices .
Sure thing .
Your price has gone up sharply , hasn't it ?
I agree with you there , but your price is unreasonable .
I don't think we'll be able to pay the price . To have this business concluded , you need to lower your price at least by 3 % .
Don't you agree with me that in the long run , moderate prices will bring about large sales and more profit ?
Is that all ?
I'm sorry we can't handle the price you offered .
It ’ s great , dad . I don ’ t mind delivering papers , but the real fun is collecting the money .
I ’ Ve never had a bank account before . Why don ’ t I just keep my money under the matters like grandpa does ?
But what if I need my money suddenly ?
Great ! So it ’ s almost the same as keeping it under the matters !
OK . Guess I have to do that before . I can make money my first withdrawal .
Yes , but you can't get there with out a change .
You have to get off at the hospital and change for bus 15 .
Oh , how splendid ! Can you take a picture of me here ?
We are here , bus station , we are in the heart of the city .
Head straight up the street about two blocks then turn right .
Working hours are from 8: 30 a . m . to 5:00 p . m . Be sure not to be late or absent . Report to the manager by filling in the ' Monthly Report ' every month .
Our company has a strict and reasonable salary standard . On the 20th day of every month , you can get your salary on time . Benefits depend upon the length of service and the employee's past attendance record .
All new members are likely to ask the same questions . Haha . I can understand that . Every month you have three days off , besides the weekends and some important holidays . After you've been here for a year , you qualify for a one-week vacation . The leave less than a half-day should predict for an hour , and more than a half-day should predict three days .
What do you mean ?
You are kidding . What happened ?
That's really surprising . I always thought they are well matched . What about the kids ? Who get custody ?
That's the change from all the back stepping we usually hear about . Well , I still can't believe it , Masha and Hero , the perfect couple . When would they divorce be final ?
I would like to make a collect call to Taipei , Taiwan , please .
Tim Chen .
The area code is 2 , and the number is 2367-9960 .
Yes . Can I help you ?
Of course I remember you .
Oh , no . Really ? I didn't see anything .
No , I didn't . Would you like to go look by the table with me ?
No . It's been empty the whole time .
I remember , sir , that your friend took the bill.You didn't pay for the lunch yourself , did you ?
Then are you sure you took your wallet out of your pocket while you were here ?
Maybe you lost it before you came here . Or maybe you left it at home .
Well , the first thing you should do is make sure it's not at home.Then , if it isn't , you need to call your credit card companies and cancel your cards . Next , you need to replace whatever you lost , your driver's license , things like that .
You can if you want . But the police usually don't do anything about lost wallets .
I'm sorry we couldn't find it , sir .
Yes . Many things ! I especially love this beautiful quilt .
It sounds like a special quilt . Why do you want to sell it ?
Oh , I see . Umm , how much do you want for the quilt ?
Let me see .
I ’ d rather you didn ’ t , Miss Yang . I ’ m very busy now .
Yes , of course .
Well , uh ... I ’ m still pretty busy , but ... all right . Come in . What can I do for you ?
Not at all . Take a seat . Now what can I do for you ?
Yes . But why should you want to do that ?
Not at all . Go ahead .
Yes . I ’ d be delighted if you did .
Take me to the airport , please .
I have to be there before 17 o'clock .
There's an extra ten in it for you if you can get me there on time .
Here's twenty dollars .
No . If you can't break it , keep the change . But can you give me a receipt ?
When did you last time have your eyes checked ?
Come over here . I will test your eyes . First cover your left eye like this , and when I point , please read the chart from the top , and go as far as you can , telling me which way the “ E ” points .
Good.Now the other eye .
Never mind , just read as far as you can .
Yes , there is an underground car park near the supermarket .
What's up , Bro ? What's in the bulletin ?
Blackout ? Even the TV has the limit .
Oops , no , Daddy can't watch American Idol , either !
Oh , my god ! No air-conditioner !
How about playing Barbie out there in the neighborhood ?
Do you have a better plan ?
I am wondering if you do facial care ?
How much would it be ?
I'm afraid 800 is too expensive for me . Could you recommend something around 300 ?
I would like to order 2 office-style cabinets and desk calendars . We want office-style cabinets in white . The catalogue number is 90 - f - 2356 .
Could you deliver it tomorrow ?
Please handle the items carefully .
We will pay by collect on delivery .
Does it have to be this afternoon , Mr . Fairbanks ? I ’ Ve already made plans .
I ’ d appreciate that , sir . How long do you think you ’ ll need me to stay ?
The buck stops here .
Well , Administrative assistant with shorthand and typing skills are badly needed here .
The position calls for a person with some working experience . We must be able to benefit from your analytical and interpersonal skills . Can you deliver your resume to us first ?
OK . I will call you soon . Bye now .
It is especially important for the graduates who step into the job market for the first time .
The contents should be mainly descriptions of your background . And the length depends on the particular situation .
To sell yourself successfully , you should leave the interviewer a deep impression .
It should also be truthful and realistic . Do not blindly blow your own horn .
While you should not omit your weak points , they need to be described appropriately
Besides , in the interview , it is best that you make corresponding adjustments to apply your prepared contents flexibly .
Hi , Deborah ! This is John . I'm calling from Australia .
I'm attending a conference in Sydney this week . Remember ?
It's 10:00 P . M . And it's four o'clock in Los Angeles , right ?
4:00 A . M . ? I'm really sorry .
I'm afraid not , we're very short-staffed at the moment . Can you ask the shift supervisor to ask one of his team to do some overtime ? Perhaps Tommy can stand in for an hour or two until we find a replacement .
Oh , you are out of breath ! What happened ?
Take it easy . They will get caught .
Sorry , but he is out for lunch right now .
I think he will be back around 2:00 . If you like , please leave your name and phone number , I'll have him call you as soon as he comes back .
My pleasure , bye !
What can I do for you ?
What's your flight number ?
Yes , it's true . It has been delayed .
Yes , of course . The delay is due to heavy rain .
I am sorry , we don't know the extent of the delay at present . But according to the latest weather forecast , there will be a change in weather soon .
It's hard to say . Weather is so changeable in the summer . Please listen to the latest announcement about your flight .
Bye
I'm worried , Tom . I haven't seen any other cars for almost an hour .
I told you we should have stayed in town today.The weather report said 100 percent chance of snow.Why did you want to come up here ?
Well , now we're stuck . What can we do ?
I've heard that when this happens , it's important to save energy .
We're stranded here , Tom . We may be here a long time.We need to conserve the gas in the car . The car's energy is what will keep us warm .
Yes , but the gas and the battery both have to stay working.We can't just let the car run and run.If we do , it will die soon . Then we'll freeze .
Turn the lights off.Then , run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour.That will conserve the heat as long as possible .
I wish we hadn't come up here . Now we'll probably be here for days .
Yes , it happens.That is what happens in big snowstorms . People get stranded for days .
Probably we'll survive.But turn the car off for about forty-five minutes . Then we'll turn it on again .
Oh , sorry . I didn ’ t know .
No , I ’ m afraid not .
Sorry .
I wanted to see the White House .
Oh , no .
Oh , well thank you very much .
I'd like the double cheese burger meal , please .
Just coke will be fine .
That sounds good , thanks , I'd like that . Actually I'd like sprite instead of coke , thanks .
Yes , that's all .
You got it .
Yes , we will depart in 10 minutes .
Yes , it is .
That's nice .
Of course not . We have cooperated for a long time .
What kind of meat would you like to get today ?
A pound of ground beef is $ 2.48 .
What else will you be needing ?
The chicken breasts cost $ 4.05 per pound .
It's going to be $ 12.15 .
Yes , Mr . Bergeron . You mentioned that in your letter . To tell you the truth , your proposal surprised us .
Do you sell direct to shops ?
Do you keep a stock of these things ?
That is , your commission .
Our agents in other areas usually get a 3-5 % commission .
According to your estimate , what is the maximum annual turn - over you can fulfill , in round figures , of course ?
We appreciate very much your intention to push the sale of our products . But our suggestion to you , Mr . Bergeron , as a preliminary step , is to do a little research into the market ...
Mr . Bergeron , you leave us no alternative . We can not give you an exclusive agency of the whole European market without having the slightest idea of your possible annual marketing turnover . Besides our price is worked out according to the costing . A 10 % commission means an increase in our price . We must have the reaction of the buyers in this respect .
Well , we can still carry on our business relationship without the agreement . To start the ball rolling , we will provide you with price lists , catalogues and some samples . Only when you have a thorough knowledge of the marketing possibilities of our products , can we then discuss further details .
Oh , yes . We will give you a 5 % commission on every transaction .
Very good . We will discuss the matter again at the next Fair .
Yes , Mr . Ransom ? This is Karl Miller . How may I help you ?
Certainly , Ms . Ransom . Do you have an order number ?
Yes , we have . Here's our CIF quotation sheet . Please have a careful look .
Yes . All the quotations on the list are subject to our final confirmation .
All these products are our best-selling lines . The prices of our products will change according to that of the international market demand . And we are always open to negotiate , especially on larger orders . What do you have in mind ?
I understand . Our offer remains open for 4 days .
Yeah , I accidentally dropped my phone in the toilet .
Sounds good . I don ’ t want it to be too expensive , maybe something mid-range .
What about Wi-fi ?
One last thing . Is it waterproof ?
Why not ? Come on ! Just a cute little puppy or a kitty !
I will ! I ’ ll feed it , bathe it and walk it every day ! We can get a Labrador or a German Shepard !
Ok . How about we get a cat or a ferret ?
Fine ! Let ’ s get a bird then ! We can keep it in its cage and teach it to talk ! A parrot would be awesome !
Yay !
Overbooked ? Give up my seat ? I don ’ t understand .
I know what overbooked is , I just don ’ t understand how that could happen ?
So who has to stay behind ?
Ok . I ’ ll volunteer . I could use a free ticket !
I ’ m glad to hear that .
You will have to pay $ 1050 every month .
What can you afford ?
I ’ ll need you to pay more than that .
How does $ 900 every month sound to you ?
We have a deal then .
Good morning , Mr . Thomas , it is nice to see you too .
I ’ Ve worked in the field for more than 4 years . Depend on my work qualifications and experience , I would like to have 5000 Yuan to start .
It is a bit lower than I expected . But I can accept that . What are the working hours ?
Do I have to work on weekend ? If so , how do you pay for the overtime ?
Is there probation ?
One Big Mac and French Fries .
Give me one coke , please .
To go , please .
And can I have some ketchup , please ?
University Street .
You'll see one at the corner on your right .
Yeah how ’ d you know ?
Yeah ! I just started my training today and I ’ m not really sure where to begin .
Well , I don ’ t want to be ripped like you ! I just want a good physique with weights and Carpio .
Got it ! Wow is that the weight you are lifting ? My goodness that ’ s a lot of weight !
Do you have a hotel card or something ?
Oh , you're staying at the downtown Hilton.Then , you go down two blocks this way and turn left.You ' ll find it on the right .
The railway station ? Just go down this street and turn left at the second corner . The station is at the end of that street .
It's about a ten-minute walk .
Not at all .
We have hundreds of constituencies and the voters in each one elect a member of parliament . Most people call them mp ’ s .
Almost all of them do . A few are independent . That means that they do not belong to a party . If one party more than half of the mp ’ s . they form a government . That means that they choose a prime Finist
This is a small group of people-perhaps 25 mp ’ s who are usually ministers . They make all the big decision and discuss laws and policy .
Any mp can present a law to parliament . The proposed law is debated and voted on . If it is accepted , it becomes law .
Yes , it does , because they have most of the mp ’ s . most mp ’ s vote the way their party wants them to .
They produce manifesto . These documents which states their policies . Some people just vote for the same party every time there is an election . Voters who often change the party they vote for are Calle
Pretty good . The HR manager asked me the usual questions . Then he wondered why I had decided to leave my previous job .
I told him that I hadn ’ t got a raise for three years . I also told him that one of my best co-workers quitted her job because she had not been promoted for eight years .
Yes . I told him that my boss made some excuses of the recession . But I thought he had a pattern and a record of promoting men only .
In a couple of days , I was told .
Thank you .
Generally speaking , he needs creativity , the ability to communicate , sense of personal responsibilities , the ability to solve problems and so on .
Yes , I have all of them . I am totally competent to be a senior executive .
Could you be a little more specific , sir ?
I understand . Now , you're saying that you've already used up all your amenities ?
So , what's the problem ?
You want some souvenirs !
But , sir , our souvenir shop carries all those items .
I understand , sir . I'll call housekeeping . You'll have your souvenirs shortly .
Yes.We ' re interested in seeing the rooms for rent .
A nice quiet house is exactly what we're looking for .
That sounds just wonderful to us .
How about this afternoon ?
No , I'll have the fish please .
No , I want the fish .
Thank you , but I prefer the fish .
No , I like the fish .
It's almost ready . Can you set the table ?
Want to taste this dish ?
Really ?
If you like to help me do the dishes , I'll be more dreadful .
Good morning , Vera , Nice to meet you .
Of course . First you should do up your long hair and do make up but not too thick .
Yes , when you attend the interview , you should pay attention to your manner , style of conversation and expression . You should keep smiling always , being polite when you talk with the interviewer . Don't move from time to time when you sit there . And you also should know how to use eye contact .
That ’ s all right . Hope you can do better tomorrow .
Well ... uh ... how about a glass of juice instead ?
Oh , yeah . Well , uh , about your mug ...
Yes , I'd like to settle my bill .
Sure . Here you are .
That much ! Would you mind letting me have a look at it ?
Thanks . Well , It seems to be right . How much is that in dollars , please ?
I see . OK .
In cash , please . Here you are .
By the way , please forward my mail to this address .
You really should go to Rachel's pet store .
it's more than special . You can find as many kinds of animals as you can put a name to and more .
snakes ? there are even rodents and monkeys ! it's a world of exotic pets .
Hang on . are you sure you want to keep a non-traditional pet ?
but it will pose a risk to your health .
i mean , most reptiles carry some harmful bacteria . they are likely to cause immune system problems .
I don't believe it's a good choice to keep those pets , especially for families with young children .
yes , good luck , Maria .
Nice to meet you . My name ’ s Sophie .
Yes , I ’ m . Are you French , too ?
What nationality are you ?
No , I ’ m not .
I ’ m a keyboard operator . What ’ s your job ?
I am proud to know that he is our President .
Did you vote for him , because I know that I did .
I have nothing but faith in Obama .
I ’ m sure he will help better America .
Our country is already changing as it is .
I trust that he will take good care of our country .
No , I ’ m afraid we don ’ t .
No , thanks , I ’ ll come back later . May I reserve a table for two ?
Bruce By the way , can we have a table by the window ?
That ’ s fine .
Yes , of course . There are many tea houses and bars in China , too . People can drink , eat and relax at these places .
Yes , sometimes the music there is so beautiful . It is very romantic . I can stay there for hours .
No , I often go there with my friends .
I see . You are in luck this month because all of our models are on sale ! it is a perfect time to buy a new car since it ’ s the end of the year .
That is the Ford Focus . A very light but powerful vehicle . It comes with dual side airbags , power steering and power windows , tinted windows and your choice of either automatic or manual transmission .
It is a very fuel efficient vehicle giving you about 34 miles in the city and 40 on the highway .
A very powerful 2.5- liter turbocharged engine , Trust me , this car is fast !
Very affordable mam . You can take it out of this lot today with 0 % down payment and no interest for the first year ! You can test drive it now and we can sign the papers when we get back .
Well , I have got a vacancy .
Eight dolls fifty a week excluding laundry .
Can you call back later ? We're right in the middle of lunch .
Here you are . Do you need glue ?
You ’ re welcome .
Hello . I'd like to speak to someone regarding my card .
No , no . Nothing at all like that . It's just that I applied for a credit card with you a while ago , my application was accepted , but I'm still waiting for my card .
Yes , my application was accepted last Friday . Now it's Wednesday , that's more than 5 days .
Of course ! How silly of me ! Yes , 5 working days would mean this Friday , at the earliest . I see . I'm sorry to trouble you .
Nothing , thanks . I again apologise for the misunderstanding , bye for now .
We'd like to order breakfast for tomorrow morning .
Orange juice , scrambled eggs , bacon , toast and coffee .
About seven thirty.By the way , could you also bring me tomorrow's papers ?
You should do one of the two things - either to lodge a claim with the shipowner or with the insurance company .
Yes . They usually do it .
Of course . In Europe , they charge a commission of 1 % of the amount of the claim for their service .
They do the work without charge to the importer .
Exactly .
No , you must also obtain a statement from the shipping agent certifying that the goods were actually loaded on their vessel for shipment .
You must provide full original set of ocean bills of lading original insurance policy or certificate and the original commercia invoice .
You are welcome .
OK , Mum , when will you be back ?
Just a minute , please . It's in my bag . Here it is .
All right . Shall I enter all my belongings ?
Yeah me too . Oh ! Can we stop at the shop really fast ? I lost my makeup bag at the airport and I want to pick up a few things .
No ! Five minutes I promise !
Are you crazy ? You have no idea what you are talking about ! Just for my eyes I have to get eye-liner , an eyelash curler , eye shadow , an eyebrow pencil and mascara . Then I need to get foundation , liquid foundation .
What about you ? You spend as much or more money on your razors , after shave , cologne and gel ! Not to mention how much you spend on clothes and ...
No !
Last time I lent you money , you never paid me back .
Ok , but I'm taking your skateboard as collateral .
It's nothing personal , just business .
Yes , please . I'm looking for a cotton polo shirt .
Not really .
I like the design , but don't particularly care for the colour . Do you have that in other colours , too ?
Yes . I prefer white - and may I see a pale yellow one , too ?
Yeah . How are you these days ?
Thank you .
I do yoga twice a weeks
It was hard at the beginning , but now feel it's really relaxing . It makes me flexible .
Yes , I often go swimming .
Yes , I like it very much .
No , I'm not .
No , I'm not . I'm going to look for an apartment .
I'm going to try to find a place near the office .
Out in the suburbs . It's a long trip to work every day .
I'm going to buy a newspaper and check the classified ads .
I know , but I'm going to enroll in a night school to take a course in business management .
no , it's definitely my turn to treat you ... you paid last time !
ok , ok , how about we just go Dutch ? It's settled . Listen , I'm still pretty new around here , would it be alright if you found the restaurant ?
What ’ s wrong with the fax machine ? Is it urgent ?
Either call this extension number 0085 or ask them to send the fax to you as e-mail , you print it out .
Do I have to get up now ?
What're you talking about ? My alarm even hasn't gone off yet .
I must have slept right through it .
Just let me sleep five more minutes .
I know , I know . But I don't want any worms .
How about the cinema ?
Oh I don't know . Titanic ?
Yes . I have a spare room .
10.00 dollars a night .
Sure.Come on in .
I feel cold , and I'm shivering . I have a terrible headache and a sore throat .
About a day .
Ah ...
Not so good .
Your pulse is weak .
Yes , you have a high fever . I'd like to give you a blood test .
I had to blow my nose .
Did you hear that ?
It wasn't that loud .
Okay . I'll take your word for it .
You're funny .
I'm going into the bathroom to blow my nose . I'll be right back .
Right away , sir .
Yes , sir , it is .
Please come again .
What you said is true . But the film producers there are more flexible ways to get more audience . For example , to make more movie Ccds , so people will spend money buying them .
Yes . Take myself for example . I seldom go to cinemas , but it doesn't mean I no longer see films ; instead , I see films at home-watching Ccds .
Yes , well Miss Childs did give mean overview of the position over the phone , but there were some details I ’ d like to clarify .
Could I first ask about the remuneration package ?
I understand . And are there other bonuses included ?
Well , Mr . Parsons , I am flexible when it comes to salary . The opportunity to work in Hong Kong for you is the most important thing for me .
How long will the system be down for ?
That's fine . We've allowed forty-eight hours to be on the safe side .
Yes , please . I'm here for an International Settlement . Our company has to effect payment , and it needs to be done today . Here's the advice slip for the payment .
I see . So , I need to stamp it . And sign it too ?
I'll go back to the office and get it sorted and pop back later . Thanks , bye for now .
If I ordered a desk today , how would it be before I got delivery in Scotland ?
Please Show your ticket and passport .
Which flight do you want to change ?
Hello , this is the apartment manager speaking .
Would you be interested in seeing the apartment ?
Are you free today at around 6 p . m . ?
Well , I'll see you at 6 p . m . Do you know how to get there ?
I'll give you an application form when I see you .
No . Just bring yourself .
Yes , here you are .
I'm the general manager of the Far-East Industry Corporation .
Yes , I have been invited by the East Import
Yes , I have some foreign currency to declare .
All right .
It'll be $ 65 for a monthly pass .
If you're in school , you can get a student pass .
The pass is free .
You'll only have to pay for the monthly sticker .
It's $ 24 for each month .
Okay , I'll get you one .
Well , it'll take three weeks to demolish the old building and clear away the debris . We should be ready to start the construction work in week 23 .
About ten weeks in total if everything goes according to plan .
Andrew , this is Linda Chen .
I need to set up an appointment to get my hair fixed .
Tuesday morning .
I'm not getting one .
It's cheaper if I don't buy one .
How do you figure that ?
Really ?
I like that .
I'm going to .
Yes , I would like a roast duck and my friend wants steaks .
I'd like it medium-well .
Usually it's 60 dollars for a manicure , and 80 dollars for a pedicure . But with this special discount , the total for both is only one hundred and 20 dollars , and you can get them painted .
Alright.Do you want your cuticles cut , too ?
Would you like the shapes square or round ?
All right , it's done . Please follow me to the drying section .
Ten or about five minutes . You'll be all set .
Oh , hello , Lucy . What's up ?
Oh , what's wrong with you ?
Well , you sound ill over the phone .
That's all right . Have a good rest until you feel well enough .
Goodbye , Lucy .
I am sorry , sir , the fish you ordered will take a longer time because we make it with fresh fish .
Sure , is dry white wine OK ?
Why , what's the problem ?
Okay .
Wonderful ! We can meet your requirements and the offer is ready for you . Here it is . The unit price is USD 15.00 per kilogram .
It's FOB Shanghai .
Certainly , that's easy . We will work out our CIF offer this evening . Could you come again tomorrow , say , at 10 AM ?
Yes , please .
What's the price difference ?
Just fill it up with Regular , Unleaded , please .
Yes , I would . Thanks a lot .
Yes , all of us have naps .
No , not at all .
Well , there are a lot of storybooks upstairs in our children's section . Some are written for young children , others for teens . Maybe some of them will suit your needs .
You're welcome .
Good morning . You are speaking to the property manager .
Was it leaking in the bedroom ?
Can you tell me which floor you are on ?
I would like to look at the leak . Will you be home this morning ?
Just in case you have to leave , we will just use the master key .
I have earned 10,000 a year including bonuses .
I like to be paid more than that . Hopefully , 150,000 a year . To be honest , I left the company to get more income .
Of course , that's my job . Oh , dear . What's happened ?
I see ... calm down , don't worry . May I ask what were you doing when it took your card ?
Mmmm ... and exactly how many times did you enter it , please ?
Ah ! Don't worry ; it's just a security measure . If someone uses a card and cannot get the right PIN after three attempts , the bank keeps the card in case it's stolen . Just contact the bank and we'll get it back to you .
Yes , they'll be happy to help . Believe me , it happens to many people .
Yes , it is .
Please show me your parcel order .
Let me check your parcel number . Song Ping's parcel number should be CP 06230221 5 CN . Here is your parcel .
Not at all .
I'm trying to decide what to wear to school the first day .
Didn't tell me what ? What ?
What are you talking about brother ? Spill it .
You mean I have to wear the same thing every day ? MOM !
Steak , please .
Medium rare , please .
May I have a glass of red wine , please ?
Yes , we do . We like it very much .
Thank you so much .
Yes , I'm glad we've had very pleasant cooperation in the previous years . And your achievement for promoting our clothes was great in the three years .
To be frank , you are not the only one who applies for an agent for us in your country . I'd like to know some ideas of terms on which you would be willing to operate as our agent .
Sounds reasonable . I will tell my boss about you agent application . Another question , what do you think is the minimum annual sales you can guarantee ?
Well . As our sole agency , you will neither handle the same or similar products of other origins nor re-export our goods to any other area outside your own .
Yes ?
Oh , let's see what's wrong .
Aisle A is where you'll find all the produce .
I'm sure something is on sale . Please check with the produce person .
Speaking .
Yeah , exactly ! I bought them last year . En ... at present , they are still in good state .
Your company is developing so fast . Maybe later on I will plan to buy more .
Bye !
Yes , sir ...
Yes , sir.Go ahead .
Sir , does this apply to intra-office communications only ? Or will it also restrict external communications ?
But sir , many employees use Instant Messaging to communicate with their clients .
This applies to internal and external communications .
Is that all ?
Let's see ... my ID card , my passport , and my suitcase . I'm pretty sure I've got everything .
Yes , what can I do for you ?
You are welcome , Mr . Sun .
Sorry , we haven't made the decision at all . But we should be making the decision by the end of this week . And we'll get in touch with you once we make it .
No .
Thank you for the calling . Bye-bye .
Any other discomfort ?
Does it occur seasonally or all year round ?
Are you sensitive to other things ?
OK . Let me examine your nose . According to your case history and the examination , I believe that it's allergic rhinitis .
I'll give you a series of specific skin tests . Then we'll know exactly what substances you're allergic to . Then I'll give you some causes of desensitization therapy .
Sure , why not ?
I see . It feels very light on the skin .
I like the cool smell , too .
First you make a list of what you wanna buy ...
Well , that ’ s a problem , isn ’ t it ?
No , I was way too busy studying all the time . How about you ?
What was that like ?
What did you do ?
Did you get any perks on the job ?
Yes . What's the buying rate for euro ?
Okay . I'd like to change some euro into US dollars , please .
Six hundred euro .
Here you are .
In fifties please .
I'm looking for a bookcase , but I don't want to buy a new one .
Not really . There aren't any used bookcases listed . But there are a few rummage sales on Saturday . I think I'll go to them .
Not at all . These private sales are great places to bargain . And sometimes you can find terrific things among all the junk .
What happened ?
Not really . I like looking on the internet at what ’ s available , but I usually prefer to actually see and touch what I ’ m buying before I pay for it . Sometimes , I ’ ll look at something in a shop , but lat
Not really . I know that it happens , but if you buy from reputable companies with secure websites , you should be ok . Even though I use online shopping facilities , I don ’ t think it ’ s the best way to sho
I do . I ’ m a big fan of using new technology , but I don ’ t want to sit in front of a computer screen all day . I think people need to get out and interact with other people .
Sure . I ’ d love to join you . Can we stop by the computer store ? I just want to see if they have something .
Ok . I ’ Ve finished online . Let ’ s go . I ’ ll just get some money and my credit card .
It suits my taste . You are really a good cook .
Wow , let me try . It tastes nice . How did you make it ?
Yes . In fact , the recommendation letter written by the university is an indirect self-recommendation . In the long period of cooperation , the university has established good relationship with the companies or organizations , they trust each other well . If your university recommends you , you can be approved more easily .
More and more persons have the same discoveries since most universities do that in order to save energy . If your university also does like this , you can look for other methods , because such kinds of recommendations say nothing for you .
It depends . If it has something special or useful , I suggest you send it out .
Just fill out an application .
You are expected to know the E-mail address of the unit .
Send out an application through Job-wanted on the website .
It's a two-way choice . And your application will be read .
Sina , 21st Century Talent Net , and a few others .
I dare you to say that again .
Yes . I was Propaganda department minister of our university .
No . It ’ s a pity about it .
Yes . I was a member of the basketball Society . I like playing basketball .
I sometimes played basketball and sometimes played football .
Yes . That is why I'm here .
I was pulled over for allegedly speeding .
To be honest , I really wasn't .
I was under the speed limit . I was going 35 , when the speed limit was 40 .
What about my ticket ? Do I still need to pay ?
I'm so glad for your help .
Yes , I like it , because it's convenient .
First , you should open an account at the online bank . After that , you can buy anything you want online .
Sure . You can find everything all over the world . Let's check it out online ! ( They log in a shopping website . )
Let's click to check it out .
So what is it ?
Another tough thing , I guess .
I don't know what happened !
No , I didn't . Really !
Yes . The reservation under Mr . Watson .
Em , no , thanks . I think we'll go straight to the table , By the way . may I check my overcoat here ?
Thank you . Could you show us to our table now ?
Thank you .
I ’ m looking for a sweater .
Well , I ’ m looking for size 10 but you don ’ t have it .
Yes , I like the color . Can I try it on ?
It fits well . I like it a lot . What do you think ?
Oh , it ’ s my favorite . How much is it ?
Okay . I ’ ll take it . Thank you very much for your help .
We have only one mid-size car left .
It's 40 $ plus tax per day on limited mileage .
Can I see your driver's license ?
Please sign here .
I think that we have a pretty good idea of what we would like to order .
I was wondering if the chef could leave off the sauce .
I am a vegetarian . Do you have any vegetarian selections ?
I think that we will split the roasted vegetable and garlic pizza .
You can bring us our salads when you bring us our entree .
Are you sure you're using the right program ?
That's why you can't open it . You'll have to upgrade before you can read the file .
Generally speaking , l am an open-minded person .
Cheerfulness and friendliness .
They say Mr . Sun is a friendly , sensitive , caring and determined person .
I admire a person who is honest , flexible and easy-going .
I get on well with others .
What seems to be the problem ?
Do you have a fever with that rash ?
I have openings on Tuesday or Wednesday . Which would be best for you ?
Fine , I am putting you down for 9
I can schedule you with him with no problem . We look forward to seeing you .
It ’ s probably just people trying to get an early start out of the city for the weekend . Nobody sticks around in the summer .
Actually , you might because there ’ s a big convention in town this weekend .
I'd like to withdraw some money from my account .
Well , actually , it's quite a substantial amount . Here's my Bank Book . Will that cause a problem ?
Yes , that seems to be all in order . Thanks very much .
Do you have many different suppliers ?
You'll never be in shape until you eat less and take more exercise .
I often eat fish and eggs .
Oh yes , and fruits . I love fruits very much .
Well , I never drink alcohol , coffee or tea .
I drink a lot of milk . I drink milk almost every day .
Well , I walk every day .
Yes , quite right .
Why do you need to leave early ?
What doesn ’ t feel right ?
Perhaps you should get checked out at the Student Health Center before you go home .
Are you going to be OK to drive home , or would you like someone to go with you ?
We hope that you are feeling better soon . E-mail me if you have any questions .
It ’ s still up in the air . There is something wrong between us .
Our price will be not less than $ 5000 .
This is already our best price .
Well , what would you suggest ?
I'm afraid that there is no room to negotiate the price . This is the best price we can quote .
What do you mean ?
You drive a hard bargain ! OK , that's a deal .
Yes , Ma'am . May I have your name and room number ?
What kind of watch is it ?
Yes , we have it .
I think that it ’ s absolutely gorgeous .
I think that the apartment looks very nice , but I do see some problems .
I did notice a few stains in the carpet .
You will ?
That was the only thing that I saw that was wrong with the apartment .
It is . I love it .
Absolutely . Here it is .
Please do , the fitting-room is over there .
I'm sorry . We don't have this color in your size . We have some green ones in your size . Would you please have a look at this green one ?
It's 486 yuan .
As I said before , your price is so high that we find it difficult to make a bid . We hope you will take the initiative and bridge the gap .
So do we . Certainly it's a step forward on your side . But the gap is still too wide .
To make your offer workable , I think you should take another step down as big as the one you've just taken .
I hate to disappoint you , Mr . Brown , but if that's the case , we have no alternative but to cover our requirements elsewhere . Do think it over , please . We sincerely hope our discussion will come to a successful conclusion .
Not at all . Shall we meet again , say , on Friday morning ?
Good morning.This is Mary.Can I speak to Anne please ?
Thank you.But I will call her later
Goodbye .
I ’ m all right , thanks . Just a little tired .
Yeah , I got home around two .
I'm afraid we'll be late for the party .
Yes , my watch says a quarter to seven . but there is something wrong with my watch !
Yes , but ever since I bought it , it gains about five minutes a day , so I ' Ve got to have it repaired .
I think about ten minutes by bus .
Wait ! I think I see a bus coming now . Let's hope it's the No . 22 bus .
I found it would be a good idea to get a check-up .
I know . I figure as long as there is nothing wrong , why go see the doctor ?
Ok .
Yes .
I've tried hundreds of times , but I just can't seem to kick the habit .
Ok , thanks doctor .
I'm afraid you've got the wrong extension .
Sure , please hold on .
Now Mr . Tylor's on the line . Go ahead , please .
You are welcome . Bye !
Hello , this is Quinn from IBA .
I'm afraid so , yes .
Unfortunately it's rather a big mistake .
I would recommend we scrap this one and you bring in another set as soon as possible .
You should go to the dentist .
Well , suffer then . If you have a toothache , you have to go to the dentist .
Stop being such a baby . If it really hurts that much , just let them knock you out .
Good . You'll feel better after you do .
Certainly sir , this is our train schedule . We have an express train departing every morning and an overnight train that departs at nine pm .
About twelve hours . We currently have tickets available only for first class on the express train . If you ’ d like , you can choose a sleeper on the overnight train which is a bit less expensive .
Yes , of course . There is a dining car towards the front of the train where they serve meals at all times . We do provide complimentary water and coffee for all of our passengers .
Here you are sir . Your train leaves from platform number nine at nine on the dot . Remember to be here at least thirty minutes before your scheduled departure time or else you might miss your train !
Have a great trip .
A trip to the beach would be fun . How is the weather going to be ?
So do you think it'll be perfect weather for the beach ?
I really hope it doesn't get cold .
The weather in California is unpredictable , so you never know .
It would be nice if the weather would never change .
True . Predictable weather would make life easier .
If we think positively , office love can be beneficial to company .
But if two employees are in love , they will be happy . Happy people are more productive . If they develop an intimate relation with each other , they are willing to share knowledge and experience . It can help to improve work efficiency .
Compared with healthy food , unhealthy food just tastes so much better . And anyway , I believe if you live a low stress Life and are active , you can get away with eating whatever you like . It's all in the mind .
What's special about these things ?
Thanks . I'm going to follow your advice and pop down to the supermarket right now .
You need to take a break , maybe a vacation .
Is that so ?
Have you decided ?
Could you tell me why you want to quit ?
Oh , that's terrible . Do you want to get a higher salary in our company ?
OK , I'd like to say that I've really enjoyed working with you . However , I think you should work harder for your new job and then you can ask for higher pay .
And every best wish for your new job .
Let me see . Oh , No . 11 .
Seats No . 20 and 21 . It ’ s nice that we ’ Ve got a window seat .
Oh , the baggage rack is full . Put them under the seat for the time being .
Let's take the bus .
It's not that bad . You probably just had a bad experience once .
We could take the subway , but we'd have to go three stops along one line and then change trains twice .
If we don't hurry up , we'll miss the show . Should we take the bus ?
I don't think we'll be able to find a taxi very easily during hush hours . Let's just take the bus .
It looks like it should be here in just a few minutes . don't worry . Nothing bad will happen . I'll even buy your ticket for you .
See , now something good has happened to you on a bus trip !
From Vancouver , we bike along the border all the way to Winnipeg .
Relatively , once we're out of Alberta , anyway . Then it's hills again in Aitoba .
That's right . And up in to Quebec . And that's where we stop .
Are you ready for the cross country of a lifetime ?
I'm Bill . I'm in Room 908 . Can you change the room for me ? It's too noisy . My wife was woken up several times by the noise the baggage elevator made . She said it was too much for her .
Anyhow , I'd like to change our room .
All right . I hope we'll be able to enjoy our stay in a quiet suite tomorrow evening and have a sound sleep .
I'm not ready to go to sleep . I'm not tired .
I'm not going to be able to fall asleep .
I've tried that before . It really doesn't work .
Why can't I just stay up until I fall asleep ?
I promise I'll go to sleep soon .
See you in the morning .
How about your psychological resilience ?
How would you deal with those who are not easy to get along with ?
You seem to be a kind-hearted lady .
Please tell me your weaknesses if you can .
Certainly . Mr . Graham . When would you like to meet ?
Fine . At 3:30 ?
Yes , at your company , I think . I'm Frank .
Nice meeting you , too .
Shame on you !
Of course . Here is our thickening mascara . We also have mascara designed to lengthen the eyelashes .
We have a very wide selection of colors . And our eye shadow is specially designed to moisturize the skin . So it is very gentle on your eyelids . Would you like to sample some ?
I can help you with that .
Yes , we are on the same plane .
So you have to bring your baggage to the transfer check-in area .
Why not go and find a porter ?
But Mom ! Today we ’ re playing football ! I love football !
I don ’ t know . It was there when I woke up this morning .
I bashed it against the chair in my room .
A little , but not much .
If I ’ m better this afternoon , can I go to school ?
You're going out of your way for us , I believe .
Yes . We need a plumber here .
I am sorry . They are not available now .
Thank you , Mary . We have been looking forward to trying out this restaurant .
Sure , that sounds great . Where are your appetizers listed ?
The chicken and cheese quesadilla looks good . Is that pretty good ?
OK , I'll take one order of that .
Perfect ! Please add on an order of onion rings .
What's wrong with the fax machine ? Is it urgent ?
Either call this extension number 0085 or ask them to send the fax to you as e-mail , you print it out .
What would you like to speak to me about ?
Is that right ?
That ’ s wonderful . I am impressed at someone so young taking a stand .
That ’ s fantastic .
I ’ m going to vote .
I will . Good luck with your volunteering .
Yes . I promise it will not happen again .
We will inform you as soon as possible .
Actually , I learn many things from it . I find that I am a quick learner in new things .
At first I didn't know anything about the machine . Now I know how to operate it . Besides , the work gives me a sense of fulfillment and achievement .
Thank you . That's a long way to go for my job .
OK , let's go .
Judging by all the traffic , I'd say we're near the outskirts of the city .
I'm not sure , but I think you turned right when you should have turned left on the flyover bridge .
It seems that the traffic sign is much more important than the map .
Yes . This is Bob Robinson . I ’ m calling from room number 627 .
Is it possible to change to another room ?
My room is facing the swimming pool . It ’ s noisy for me . I have a problem sleeping . And I feel uncomfortable when I take an elevator .
You ’ re right .
Thank you .
That ’ s fine . Can I move now ?
Oh , thank you kindly .
Let's see . You are importing fifty containers of textiles from China . They should be able to place your order before the end of next week . It will take 2 days for shipping to the port city of Ningpo . The freight will take 3 weeks on the open ocean and will arrive in Los Angeles approximately a month from today . Domestic shipping will be your responsibility , you can make arrangements with the pier in Los Angeles .
No , the Chinese company has that all worked out . With the paperwork you receive with the shipment , you should be good to go .
Do you have any other particular conditions that you would like the company to take into consideration ?
You may ask questions about us , if you have any .
I would like to fight my ticket .
Yes , the officer is here today .
I was pulled over for running a red light , but I never did .
There was a camera on the signal . So , he was obviously lying .
A picture of my license plate was never taken .
Thank you . I'm glad that you believe me .
Hi , Rita , I'm just looking for a pair of shoes . I won't be here for long .
That's my problem . I don't have a lot of options .
Yes , but I have unusually big feet . That wouldn't be too much of a problem except that they're also very wide , and only a few brands sell shoes that I can fit into .
Well , first of all , I can only go to certain stores that can guarantee me a large selection .
After that I choose something from one of the few brands that I know will fit me . I prefer white , so I ask them to bring me a pair of white sneakers in my size . Since I ’ m usually only given one or two pairs of shoes that meet my qualifications , it makes it a very easy choice .
how about going to the Olympic souvenir store to have a look ? I remember there is one in the gym .
me , too . What did you have in mind ?
I agree . They're very lovely , especially " Huan Huan " .
the five dolls are sold together as a set , and they're priced according to the size . The bigger they are the more expensive .
I don't think so . All the souvenirs of the Olympic Games are very hot right now .
there are lots of things , such as postcards , key chains , posters and various arts and crafts .
You don ’ t have to eat them . I don ’ t mind .
No dessert for you unless you eat all your vegetables .
You can have some fruit for dessert . If you eat an apple and a banana , I might let you have a small piece of chocolate cake .
I ’ ll remember that for next time . You ’ ll get extra peas and carrots , buy no broccoli or cauliflower . OK ?
It ’ s a pleasure to show our factory to our customers . What ’ s your general impression , may I ask ?
That ’ s our latest development . A product with high performance . We put it on the market just two months ago .
Certainly . No one can match us as far as speed is concerned .
Right . Here is our sales catalog and literature .
Not completely . Our production process is partially-automated . We use robots on the production line for routine assembly jobs but some of the work is still done manually .
Well , the parts are automatically selected from the store room using a bar-code system . And there is an automatic feeder which takes them to the conveyor belt at the start of the production line .
They're transported to the workstations on automated vehicles - robot trucks - which run on guide rails around the factory .
Yeah , you get the TV to yourself while I spend my nights surfing the Net for missing classmates .
I guess . Don't you have reunions in Taiwan ?
Ours are for everyone that graduated in the same year .
I'm the Project Manager so I have to make sure our projects run smoothly . I work with three Project Engineers . They take care of after-sales service and look after the maintenance side of the business .
Besides Chinese , I can speak English and French .
No , I can only carry on a simple conversation in French .
I can speak the language better than read and write .
I think so . I used to be an interpreter .
The amount of English I know enables me to do general desk work . I believe what I know is sufficient to work in an American firm .
Let me have a look . Well , how many kinds of steaks do you have ?
Is there something go with the filet steak ?
Just a minute . I need to make a list of thinks that we need .
I don ’ t have onions on my list . I ’ ll add them . We should get some tea . Is green tea ok or should we get the same tea that we usually get ?
Yes , it is . Here ’ s my list . Is there anything that I ’ Ve forgotten ?
What kind of cheese do you want .
We don ’ t have enough cash , so I ’ ll take my credit card and we can pay with that . Where are the car keys ?
If you want to order meals , call 8801.If you need other help , call 8803 and someone will be there .
Yes , you can take your letters to the counter over there .
Of course you can . I am sure this one works very well . I just sent dozens of pages . How many pages are you sending ? Are you familiar with my fax machine ?
Yes , it will print immediately .
Let me see , about five years , we established our business relationship with Hua Mei of China Import & Export Corporation in 2003 .
I don't think I have any problem with our Chinese partners . They have always followed the contract strictly . We can do business directly with the corporation . As I mentioned before , the Chinese government is trying very hard to perfect its law . Its commercial legislation provides legal protection for foreign companies .
Actually not at present . But we are afraid it will . You know policies influence business to some extent . I hope our government will not be influenced by some extremists . China is really a large market . We don't want to lose it .
You're welcome .
Here you are . That will be five dollars . Anything else ?
Just a moment , I'll look up the rate for air-mail letters to South America .
Do you have the package with you ? I would have to weigh it to see how much it would cost .
Yes . All you have to do declare the value of the package and decide how much you want to insure it for .
The post office rarely loses package . You can , however , request a rectum receipt .
We open at eight-thirty in the morning and close at five-thirty in the afternoon .
Hi there , I ’ m Bill Gotcha , the owner of Gotcha Enterprises . Did you find your way here OK ?
Why are you switching jobs at this point in your career ?
What are you best at ?
What is your biggest challenge in terms of skills ?
That is good to hear !
Good morning . I'd like to speak to Peter . Chen Please .
This is Tim . Hunter from Hunter industries .
We have an appointment for this afternoon . Mr . Chen will know why I'm calling .
OK , what does that entail ?
Yes , it does seem a little silly to cash it now . I'll probably need about 25,000 RIB . Will that be a problem ?
I'm glad you thought of this . I'd have just gone ahead and cashed it ! And I suppose I can use the money from the certificate to pay back this Personal Durable Commodities Loan and I won't lose any interest , right ?
Absolutely , Jenny . Thanks very much , I think you've saved me quite a lot of money today .
I just got it at the special health store . It's for my flabby arms .
I have to say , I have had enough of this roller coaster .
Last week I was down to 60 kilos . This week I had one donut more . Now I'm up to 62 kilos .
Of course .
Lobster ? It is steamed and served with our special sauce .
Sure . It is a most popular dish .
Not yet , I must water the garden first .
I ’ m afraid I must . Look at it ! It ’ s terribly dry .
Last summer it was very dry , too . Don ’ t you remember ? I had to water it every day .
Yes , Look out of the window .
That was a pleasant surprise . It means I can have tea , instead .
Why don't you have any money for another bus ?
That was smart .
I don't have any .
Get a transfer from the bus driver .
It doesn't cost anything .
You know what ? Don't mention it .
Hello , doctor .
I've got a backache .
No , I don't . I've never had a bad one before .
About four days ago .
Can you give me some medicine ? It's very painful .
Here you are .
Thank you . Where can I put my suitcase ?
Everyone's attention , please . We are going to take off . Please fasten your belts .
Quite good . Excuse me , are there any places of interest ?
Thank you . I think today we will go there .
Right . I'd like to deposit 2,000 RIB into my Current Account .
What ? What's wrong ?
It does look a little strange , I didn't notice that before .
Um ... Uh ... I'm just looking , thanks .
No , no , no . I'm just browsing . Thanks anyway .
Um ... well , where's the men's shoe department ?
Thanks .
I advise you to read Playboy.You can get a lot from it .
That's why it's interesting .
No , I don't . I left it home .
I didn't know . I'll go to get it . How late will you be open ?
I haven't heard anything .
Are you serious ?
That's great . Congratulations .
You have no idea how happy I am for you .
I believe you were the best choice for that promotion . I really do .
I like Chinese food , too . I like dumplings best .
That's good . We eat Chinese food only at the Chinese restaurant .
Really ? That's wonderful !
Does the class start again , Mam ?
Oh , breaktime flies .
Mam , another minute , could I ?
I feel dizzy and weak . And I'm having this pain in my ear . I think I am sick .
No , this is the second time .
Why this happens to me when I am on the plane ? I feel bad .
What should I do about it ?
OK , thanks . Does it work really ? I'll give a try .
Much better . Thank you . I just feel tired but I can't fall asleep .
I am not used to wearing that . Thanks .
Thank you so much .
Yes , I ’ m the manager here . What can I do for you , Madam ?
Which room are you in ?
I ’ m awfully sorry to hear that . I ’ ll turn to it right away .
Sure , but you have to pay $ 3 for it .
Well , ou can't hear music until takeoff .
What do you think of the pamphlets with beautiful pictures ?
I'll buy an electric map of the city .
Do you have any form of ID ?
I ’ m afraid not . It has to be a passport or a valid driver ’ s license .
OK , just fill in this application . You can sit over there . This brochure explains our services . We have free checking , and you will be given a debit card and on ATM card . There is no service
Hello . I'm not sure who I need to speak to . I got this 50 yuan note today and it seems a little odd to me .
What happens now ?
I'm afraid I can't .
Well , my car won't start . I don't know what's the matter with it .
No , I don't think it could be . I checked the battery two days ago.It must be other problems .
No , there is plenty of gas . I filled it up yesterday .
Yes , that's possible .
I'm reading a novel , The mill on the floss , written by the famous novelist gorge alias .
It's meanly about relationship between a brother and a sister , who live in the mill on the river floss . It describe there are childhood and disputes cause them to separate , the book ends with them ha
Not really , i would consider it easy .
I really like short stories .
Certainly I have . I like to read books on vary subjects , and i can read everything I can get my hands on in my spare time . I don't want to idle away and waste my time .
What kind do you have ?
Make it French please .
Not yet . But do you have any experience as an assistant ?
OK . It sounds fine .
I'd like to have a look at your air conditioners . Hum , this one looks pretty good .
And what about your customer service ?
How long is the warranty ?
Very good . I ’ ll take it .
Oh , that must be me ! Probably they typed the name wrong.My husband's English isn't so good .
It's okay . It's probably my husband's fault.Is there a pool in this hotel ?
Good .
Thank you .
Would you like to go by train or by bus ?
The bus is cheaper but also slower . It will take about two-and-a-half hours .
If you take the fast train , it will take about 50 minutes .
The trains for Cambridge leave from King's Cross Station . They run approximately every half hour . Most trains to Cambridge go from Platform 9 .
The best way is to take an underground tube train directly to King's Cross . The Underground station is just round the corner from here .
It is very easy . Just turn right when you leave and then turn right again at the first crossroads . The entrance to the Underground station is about 50 meters further on .
You're welcome .
From the numbers , it seems like Forest Inc . is our digest competitor ... Le'Ban and Markford are also major contenders in our market .
here's information about our competitor's recent market activities ...
We're in a very competitive environment . It's sink or saimin this market .
Hi . I would like to make a reservation on this Friday .
I want a single room with ocean view . Do you have one ?
OK . I will take it .
I guess I am going to arrive at 9:00 in the morning and I would like to leave at 200 in the afternoon on Sunday . Please give me a room away from the elevator . I hate noises while I am sleeping .
OK . Let me send a memo around .
I don ’ t think he ’ s back today .
I know , it ’ s a big one .
No . I don ’ t . Please .
I have a little problem , I'm overweight for my height . I think I should go on a diet .
Is there anything wrong ?
It's hard for us to believe it . Our instruments have been the best quality for years . Have you any reliable evidence ?
Well . According to the contract , we are responsible for repairing or replacing those defective instruments . We ’ ll send our technicians to repair them .
I am sorry about the quality problem , but I propose we compensate you for 3 % of the total value apart from the inspection fee .
Oh where was that ?
Grannie always tries to stay fit and healthy . She is always making us kids eat the proper foods .
She will be 86 next month .
Yes . By the way , you are having a great make-up today . I like the color of your lipstick . So adorable !
Well , girls like us are happy to spend our time on those kinds of things . Actually , do we still have a meeting this afternoon ?
No , I haven't had the pleasure .
All right .
Did you have hotel card or something ?
Oh , you stay at the down town Hilton . When you go down two blocks this way and turn left , you will find it on your right .
I did it myself . I went online and found a lot of website devoted to home improvement . Then I went to DIY shop and bought everything I needed . I ’ m sure I saved a lot of money by doing it myself and it was fun too . I learnt a lot by doing it myself .
Yes , they are . I gave them a good clean . They are in good condition and don ’ t need to be replaced .
As I hadn ’ t done it before , I had to keep referring to income 3ation I got from the internet . Doing the floor tiles took a whole day-from early morning to right through to the evening . Then I spent a few hours replacing the cracked wall tiles . Putting the cupboard up took about an hour , so it took me two days altogether .
You ’ ll be lucky ! However , I ’ ll print out the income 3ation I got from the internet and you can do it yourself .
You mean this one ?
Oh , this one ... Here .
Sure .
Cash or charge ?
We have the offer ready for you . Let me see ... here it is . 100 cases Houston Bristles , 57 mm , at 10 pounds sterling per kilogram , C . I . F European Main Ports , for shipment in June 2001 . The offer is valid for five days .
I ’ m a little surprised to hear you say that . You know very well that markets for bristles have gone up a great deal in recent months . The price we offer compares favorably with quotations you can get elsewhere .
But you must take the quality into consideration . Everyone in the trade knows that US ’ s bristles are of superior quality to those from other countries .
There ’ s practically no substitute for bristles for certain uses . That ’ s why demand for natural bristles keeps rising in spite of cheaper synthetic ones . To be frank with you , if it were not for the long - standing relationship between us , we would hardly be willing to make you a firm offer at this price .
Glad to meet you.Would you mind if I ask you some questions ?
Why do you want to go to the US ?
Will you get any kind of scholarship ?
Yes . I graduated from shanghai University and later obtained a master's degree from Oxford .
My graduation thesis is on International Trade .
Which account would you like to open ?
It is 3.2 % . You may earn a little interest on money .
Yes , the opening minimum deposit is 1,000 Yuan .
For the later deposits , you can deposit any you want . Even one Yuan is OK .
Your ID , please .
Wait a moment , please ... Here is your bankbook . Keep it well please .
Yes , I went to Cambridge . After graduation , I started right away into the advertising industry . Later , I made a bit of a switch to focus on marketing research .
I have ten years marketing experience . This includes both entry level and management positions . In my last position , I worked my way up to being director of the marking department .
I felt after five years in one place , I was ready for something new . I would like to have a job that is challenging , something that I can see and do new things every day . I loved many things about my former job , and I left with amiable feelings on both sides . I was just ready for something new .
I would rather work full-time .
I am willing to negotiate , but I expect at least $ 40,000 a year .
I feel sorry for you . It's a jungle out there .
Well . I guess I can ask around to see if anyone's got a room or apartment available .
How much do are you looking to spend ?
Looks like you'll have to get a place in the suburbs .
Anything you need to have in the place ?
You can also check out university bulletin boards .
Not really , but landlords put up notices to attract students and they often have low rent .
Good luck .
Certainly , sir . How much do you draw ?
Yes , sir . Your balance is RIB 34,000 .
Yes , I am , Your Honor .
Your Honor , the police officer pulled me over for speeding .
No , Your Honor , I was not .
I was going 35 in a 40 mph zone .
So , I don't have to pay the ticket ?
Thank you very much , Your Honor .
How did you finally do it ?
Like snacking ?
I get what you mean .
I'm impressed . Good for you !
OK ! We'll see it .
We can provide you with standby letter of credit established by Bank of China .
Yes , you are supposed to pay it on time . If you don't furnish a tender bond on time , your tender will not be considered . Besides , you also should provide derailed engineering of the good .
To our office which is on the third floor .
Yes . All the bidders will be invited to join us to supervise the tender-opening .
Yes , so far as we know , in the field , your company has lots of experience and we hope you will consider the tender seriously .
Bye !
Tsingtao beer ?
Really ?
How about its taste ?
That sounds great . Two Tsingtao beers , please .
Tin , please .
No , thank you .
Do you know various funds and accounts ?
Great . We have a very pleasant working condition and I think we have a fine staff to work with .
All right . Let me have a check . Can you tell me how can you inspect your exported goods ?
That is good . And here I give you a piece of advice . You should have used stronger cardboard boxes for such a heavy item . Besides , it's better to secure the cartons with metal straps . What's more , the order number wasn't anywhere on some of the boxes .
Thank you . Can I open the packages to check the color and style ?
The color and style are consistent with the sample . Great !
Yes , that's for sure . There is nothing wrong with the quality . I think you'd better pack them first in plastic bags , than in cartons .
Honey , I have a lot of work to do .
No .
What park do you want to go to ?
Haven't we been these places already ?
What about the Olympic park ?
The Olympic Park has a small forest . It is fit for picnic .
You are late . The last piece has sold out .
There are several , take a piece . The crash appears in the headline . It is famous for offering catastrophe stories .
There are various magazines in the rack .
That's the top magazine in America and is popular with young people . OK . It is totally 30 dollars .
Have a nice trip .
I've been told about something called Southern Fund . How can I buy it ?
That sounds simple enough . Do you charge any admin fees for that ?
Do you need any other documentation from me ?
What ?
No ! He hit me first .
No , I haven't .
Describe her to me .
Well , how tall is she ?
What does she look like , though ?
I may know which girl you're talking about .
Yes , I have .
I'm sorry ; he's out at the moment .
I think he'll be back in about an hour at least .
Yes , of course .
Ok . Does he know your number ?
13924774026 . All right . Thanks for calling . Oh , hang on , someone's at the door that may be him , please hold on .
Well , I think you'll like the mangoes .
It's a fruit . It has a big stone in it .
No . You would break all your teeth on it .
The sale price today is $ 1 each .
They usually taste sweet , but they remind me of an orange .
Don't cut into them until you can feel that they're soft on the outside .
They come from tropical countries .
Thank you .
No , I haven ’ t had any professional experience , but I have always been interested in creative writing .
Yes , my college teacher was an Australian . She was also our adviser on our English language newspaper . I was the editor for two years .
Well , I planned the layout of the newspaper and then I assigned various articles and columns to other students to write . I wrote the editorial each time .
To be frank with you , I would like nothing better than to be an overseas reporter some day .
Yes , I know that . But I like adventure and excitement in my writing .
I would be glad to do routine work sometimes , if I could be assured of making advancements in the future .
Fine . Thank you very much .
Yes , of course.When ?
Now let me check my schedule ... OK , you could to my office then .
Linda , this is David Wang .
I need to talk with Marry .
Thanks .
Those are beautiful . They smell lovely . Thank you .
Oh , sweet . You've always been my love too .
I'll do everything for you , love . You know that , maybe you didn't realize , but you made everyday a enjoys moment and happy occasion .
I have a question .
Why do people like all this fancy , expensive underwear ?
I'm just curious . I think women are beautiful without this stuff .
I feel sick .
Thank you .
No , thank you . I'll be all right as soon as the plane gets out of this turbulence .
I'm sorry about that , sir . I'll get you another one .
I see . Maybe I can offer you a credit note .
OK , sir . I'll see what I can do .
No , thanks . I've decided to give up smoking .
Well , it's just that I think if you don't enjoy doing something any more , you should stop doing it .
That's right . You should give it up , too.It ' s bad for your health .
But it's true . It's a nasty habit . I can't think why I ever started.Anyway , it's obviously got you in its grip !
I mean you couldn't give it up !
Ok , what do you want me to do ?
Ok . I ’ ll put the plates and cutlery away as I dry them . Where is the tea towel ? Oh , here it is .
While you ’ re cleaning the cooker , I ’ ll wipe the worktop . That was a great meat , by the way .
My pleasure ! This tea towel ’ s a little ragged . Do you have another one ?
Keep it and use it as rag . You can clean your bicycle with it .
Sure , I ’ d be glad to . What time frame did he have in mind ?
Mm , yeah , that ’ ll be great . Tell him I ’ ll see him then .
Well , depends . You see , there are eight famous Chinese food cuisines , for instance , sichuan cuisine and HUNAN cuisine .
That ’ s right . If you have hot dishes , you can try some .
And there are Cantonese cuisine and Kiangsu cuisine .. Most people like them .
There ’ re Beijing roast duck .
You can find it in most restaurant . The best place certainly is Quanjude restaurant .
Not too near but not too far either . A taxi will take you there in fifteen minutes . the traffic is not too bad , I mean .
Let me write it down on a piece of paper for you . You can show to the taxi driver .
I ’ d rather you didn ’ t , Miss Yang . I ’ m very busy now .
Yes , of course .
Well , uh ... I ’ m still pretty busy , but ... all right . Come in . What can I do for you ?
Not at all . Take a seat . Now what can I do for you ?
Yes . But why should you want to do that ?
Not at all . Go ahead .
Yes . I ’ d be delighted if you did .
Yes , could I make a reservation to New York on July 21st , next Friday ?
That's too bad . What's the earliest flight available ?
What about the fight schedule ?
Is it a non-stop flight ?
Sounds good . I'd like to take this flight .
Economy class .
Edward Smith .
Yes , many thanks . Goodbye .
Sure , Richard . What ’ s on your mind ?
Well , why don ’ t we sit down and work out the numbers ? We can always scale down the bonuses if we have to .
So you have to open all the envelopes .
Do you need to file copies of the letters before sending them ?
I take care of the letters . I may read , sort out and organize incoming mails .
Yes , except the personal mail . And I also need to prepare the materials for posting and check the e-mail box regularly .
Yes , and I check all the e-mails for Mr . Thomas .
Red roses are always a popular gift for birthdays .
They're only $ 20 a dozen .
Yes , you're saving money because they're on sale today .
Could I interest you in anything else ?
Your wife will be thrilled with the roses .
About what ?
Oh , really ?
I am very impressed .
That is very nice of you .
Yes , I am going to vote .
Thank you and good luck .
If the weather is good , I'll go to climb mountains .
No , I'm going alone .
Of course not . For me , mountaineering is both relaxation and a hobby .
Yeah , you are right , but it's really interesting .
What does it do ?
Wow ! What else does it do ?
Cool ! Anything else ?
Wow !
Yes .
My name is James .
American .
I don't know him .
Because he beat me first when I tried to stop him from grabbing my bag and running away .
I stabbed his belly three times .
I knew , but I couldn't control myself .
No . I didn't kill him on purpose , madam . It's him who caused the incident . I need to see my attorney .
Today I'm here to find out about paying in foreign currency . You do that here , I suppose ?
My nephew has told me about something called a ' timing deposit ' or something like that ?
Put me down for 2 years . Here's the money I'd like to pay in ...
No . you ’ re going the wrong way . You wanna 103 from the Beijing zoo .
You get off at the next stop , cross the street and you will find the stop not far on the right hand side .
Here you are .
Can't I play more ?
Mom , I'll be finished soon .
Is it my turn ?
Not too long.Cut a little off behind and on both sides , too .
About 12 hours .
Most people do when they travel long distances .
8: 00 Beijing time .
This is a special adhesive for easing the pain . Apply it to the painful area and change it in every 2 days .
Apply some of the ointment , and rub it into the skin .
Not at all .
Oh , Brian . That ’ s really sweet of you guys . I would love to get together with all of you . How about Friday ?
I ’ m free all afternoon . Why don ’ t we meet at 1 o ’ clock in the lobby ?
I ’ ll be glad to . But my schedule is super tight this week . I think the only time I have free is at lunch on Wednesday .
All right , then . I ’ ll see you at noon on Wednesday .
How long have you been feeling this way ?
You seem to have picked up some kind of infection .
Take a few days off from work and don't wear yourself out .
I'm not sure , what about you ?
Sure sounds good to me .
No , not yet .
I'm going to clean it up later .
I'm going to clean it .
I know . I'll do it .
I'm not going anywhere until later , so I'll clean it then .
I'm from Lexington Software and I'm here to collect an export L / C .
Great . Can I take it with me now ? Or do you need me to fill in some forms or something ?
Here you are .
No problem , I'll get on that right away . Thanks , bye .
What do you need ?
He seems to be quite qualified . If it is a personal problem I preferred if you would work out between yourselves .
Oh , my dear lady . Take it easy . You should forgive a green hand like him .
I suggest you talk with him and teach him how to deal with the problems .
Maybe you should communicate with him just like a friend and not a boss .
Just take them for your good friends and have a talk with them as we do , make sure you don't lose your temper .
I disagree . All you have to do is respect the staff and their opinions .
yeah , you know what ? I've been going to the club regularly . The training really pays off . Now I am in a good shape and I know more about how to keep fit .
it's important to do proper exercises .
the trainer tells me , besides regular sports activities , I should also have a healthy and balanced diet .
we should eat more vegetables instead of junk food to stay energetic .
surely it is . Getting enough sleep is also crucial for fitness .
yeah , he advises me to stay in a good mood . That can help one to keep sound physical health .
you bet it !
I stayed with my friends .
I'm sorry , Mum .
Just Mr . White .
He wouldn't say over the phone .
I want to do some management job since I have three-year's work history .
I would apply my specialty and experience to my job and gradually move up to the management level in this company .
Sorry . I didn't mean to .
while I think it's great that they're trying to get people to quit smoking , but I don't really care for the advertisement .
the fish hook that they use is quite disturbing !
I know , but I think it's not really appropriate for young children .
all advertisers like to catch young people because they know the meaning of loyalty .
I have nothing against them putting the advertisements in magazines and newspapers that are read by adults , but I don't think they should have their ad on billboards where children can see them .
you have to give them credit , though . It's about time people started becoming more aware of the dangers of smoking .
This is he . Who ’ s calling , please ?
Hello , Chris . How can I help you ?
Certainly . A letter must be sent out of the company and must be mailed or posted . A memorandum is a communication within an organization .
No , not necessary . Usually we have a set form which is printed . We just fill in the printed forms and send it to the person or the offices concerned in the company .
Sorry , it ’ s all sold out .
We have tickets for the matinee . It starts at 3p . m .
Where would you like to sit ?
Certainly .
Cancelled ? That's just can't happen !
Oh , I hope it be fixed on Friday .
Yes . I would like to place a collect call .
Terry and his number is 4562325 8 .
I would be happy to help . What would you like me to help with , food or entertainment ?
That will work out fine . To make sure everything goes together , do you think this party should be casual or dressy ?
That will work out fine . Do you think that Chinese or Continental food would be best ?
Yes , that will work out fine . Should we hire a band or bring in a DJ ?
Everything sounds great then ! I'll meet you back here on Friday to discuss the details .
It's right here . $ 100 .
Ours are of really good quality .
Well , I swim and run every day .
Well , I don't eat any meat , but I do eat fish and eggs .
Oh yes , and fruit , I love fruit .
Well , I never drink alcohol , coffee or tea . They are very bad for you .
There's a taxi rank over there , right outside the gate .
The fundraiser events went really well . We were able to partner with a few of our competitors , all in fun of course , to sponsor a marathon for the American Cancer Society . All of the people who participated it had a great time , and we were able to raise a lot of money to contribute to cancer research .
Each of the runners that participated the marathon race paid a ten dollar entrance fee . Also , they went door to door to get sponsors who pledged a dollar per mile that participants ran . All in all we were able to raise several thousand dollars .
In all honesty , it's also a great deal for our company . The exposure that we gained from sponsoring an invent like this was great for our image in the community . We accomplished as much as last year's advertising campaign , plus we were able to do a little fundraising for a good cause .
I need to open a second account .
I need another savings account .
I sure do .
That ’ s fine .
Transfer $ 100 .
That ’ s fine . Thank you .
I have been doing quite well . As reach 90 % and Bs reach 100 % . And I ’ Ve received Scholarship two times .
Yes . To develop my knowledge , I studied Economics , Business Administration and Accountingthrough self-study . Nowadays , I have passed three courses on CPA .
Yes . I used to be the monitor of my class .
It ’ s a very important experience for me . First , it improved my organizing ability , and let me understand how to resolve a problem in the overall perspective instead of my own perspective . Second , it let me know how to cooperate in harmony with people who I like or dislike .
Yes , I used to work as an assistant lawyer for Tienda Law Office .
An old one .
It's a Chevrolet . Why do you ask ? You going into the car business ?
well I have been thinking about getting a newer car . I can't afford a brand new one .
Is it a four-door or a two-door ?
Does it have automatic transmission ? .
I guess I might take a look at it .
Your main job is serving the clients and giving them what they want .
You'd spend 30 % of your time on the computer . You may be bored with a job like that .
Yes , I ’ m here to see Joanna Stevens . I have an appointment at four .
Sure , it ’ s Josh O ’ Neil .
Yes , a coffee would be nice , thank you .
They turned me down .
I think the only reason is that I was too nervous during the interview and I couldn't express myself the way I wanted to .
It doesn't matter . I'll try other companies .
On the Internet ? I've never heard of it .
Is that safe ?
Thank you for your advice . I'll have a try .
OK . How much is the fare ?
45 yuan ? It is too much , Are you sure ?
Is there something wrong with your meter ?
OK . Could you give me a receipt ?
Not at all .
You ’ re welcome . I prefer a window seat .
Yes , I have been always learning the Economics on my own . My dream is to get a master's degree in Economics .
Really ? It is amazing . I will apply for a position in your company .
What's it look like , lady ? This is the ticket line I'm standing in , isn't it ?
So , what's your beef anyway , lady ?
Oh sure , lady , and fat chance I'd get a ticket before they're sold out . I'm staying right here , understand ? So be a nice lady and butt out !
Because I'm no sucker ; only suckers go to the end of the line . It's as simple as that , lady .
Okay , lady , just to show what a gentleman I really am , I'll let you go in front of me . Now , just buy your ticket and shut your trap , will you , lady ?
What was that you just said ? Last one ... ? Hey , they've closed the ticket window !
Lady ! This is unfair ! I've been cheated ! I was in line before you.That should have been my ticket ! Come on , hand it over , lady !
Yes . Fill it up , please .
Regular , please .
Yes , please .
Take care ! I will miss you so much .
I haver run out of gas .
Premium , please . By the way , please don't fill it up . Two gallons will be fine .
Can we go somewhere nearby ? I don't feel like walking too far .
I mean the food for something spicy .
That sounds great . I love Korean food .
Yes . I ’ m trying to find a pair of earrings to match my necklace . Can you recommend some to me ?
These look wonderful . Do these come with a guarantee of quality ?
I ’ ll take them .
Oh , dear . What was in it ?
Well . Go to the police station and see if it ’ s there .
Yes . I urgently need a room for tomorrow night , and do you have any vacancies ?
I'd like a suite with an ocean view , please .
Good morning ! I am Anna Lu . I've come for an interview which was arranged .
Glad to meet you , Mr . White .
Yes . Since I entered college , I have been working at a fast food restaurant as a part-time waitress .
3 years .
That's why I applied for this job . Now I am studying Hotel English in my college , and I am quite familiar with the western courtesy and restaurant etiquette . I am sure my public relation skills will leave a strong impression on your customers .
I don't mind that .
When am I supposed to start working ?
Yes , I will . Thank you , Mr . White . Goodbye !
I'm afraid so .
Sure . Why don ’ t you try it on ? The fitting room is over there .
I ’ m thinking about buying this sweater . I know it ’ s June now , but it will be perfect for autumn and winter .
Yes , it ’ s half price . It ’ s supposed to be too large--that ’ s the fashion .
There.It looks great , don ’ t you think ? I ’ m going to get these jeans as well . I need a new pair . I ‘ m also going to buy this scarf ready for winter .
Don ’ t worry . I ’ Ve got my credit card . You can pay me back later .
This is Mr Brown speaking . I'd like to speak to Mr . Thomas , please .
That's bad ! I've been trying to call him for the last ten minutes , but your line has been busy . Will he be back soon ?
Is there anywhere I can reach him ?
I have a business appointment with him for tomorrow morning at ten o'clock , but I'm afraid I can't make it .
Unfortunately , I'm leaving town rather unexpectedly , and I may be gone for several days .
Thank you .
There ’ s an interesting interview with a top fashion designer about the latest fashions . I enjoyed reading her thought . The “ which ? ” section is very interesting this month . They tested facial cleaners . The article recommends “ all clear ” for effectiveness and price .
Which tests do you mean ?
Oh , I see . I like to do those tests , too , but I don ’ t take them seriously .
Hi Marry , this is Tom .
I need to see if we can get together today .
Do we need to put on the jackets too ?
Thank you . Is the production line fully automated ?
I see . How do you control the quality ?
What ’ s the monthly output ?
What ’ s your usual percentage of rejects ?
That ’ s wonderful . Is that where the finished products come off ?
With pleasure .
No problem .
No need , sir .
Can you give me the number for Jessica Hanson on locks Ave ?
Yes , I ’ m pretty sure .
Yes , I do . It ’ s 109 Locks Ave , L8V 4N9 .
I see . Thanks anyway .
Ok , you have to fill out the form . And I let me see three identification cards or documents .
Let me see them . Yes . There ’ re ok .
You can deposit and ensure amount of ten dollars .
You will receive the tender notice next month and you'll find the information .
I believe your corporation will try your best and I understand fully your feeling , if your tender conditions proved be suitable for our general conditions of tender , we will accept your submission of tender .
That's all right . You can contact me later if you have other questions after you read the tender notice .
Bye !
Yes , we had a meting about it yesterday afternoon .
We decided that we could agree to your price , but we are a bit worried about the slow delivery .
Yes , but we hope that the wool could reach us as soon as possible .
Good , if you agree we'll draft the agreement right away and sign it then .
What happened ?
Speaking .
Sending it won't be necessary . I'm actually coming in for a meeting with my Personal Banker this afternoon .
Indeed . Is there anything I need to do before I collect it ?
I'm sure it'll be fine . How about my PIN number ?
Great . I'll be in later today . Thanks for calling . Bye .
I have no idea . What about you ?
I ate pizza the other day .
How about some burgers ?
What are we going to do ?
That sounds like a plan .
I think they sell both at the cafeteria .
Yes , here is my Certificate of Nurse .
I learnt nursing through theory and practice for 3 years at Hunan Nursing School .
Yes , pretty well . I have started learning English since primary school .
My husband and I have thought about it , but we've decided not to have any . They're just too expensive . Besides , with all the news about global warming on the news lately , who knows what kind of Worl
For me , growing up in a big family always made me yearn for attention . I always wanted to be an only child so that I could always do what I wanted and so that I wouldn't ever have to share .
No way ! I spent 20 years of my life with relatives around me 24-7 . You know , I don't think I've ever actually spent any time by myself in my parents ' home . What do you think fo the one-child policy
That's true . But as a woman , I'm glad that even though I don't want any children , I at least have a choice in how many children I have . On the other hand , I can't imagine what China would be like
I don't know what other people think , but I , for one , envy only children !
I know , I know . OK , so I have to separate the colors from the whites and put them in this strange looking contraption so called washing machine .
So complicated ! Ok , what about this red wine stain ? How do I get it out ?
Cool . Then I can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it ’ s all set right ?
You know what ? I ’ ll just have everything dry cleaned .
No , he is at work now .
Sure . It's 289,1234 .
Driving ? No way , it's too far .
Too long , and you do not have much time .
Thank you .
They're over there next to the door . Those three with green tags on them .
Sure , here it is .
Yes . I bought the can two days ago , but today I found that is beyond the guarantee period .
The railway station ? Just go down this street and turn left at the second corner . The station is at the end of that street .
It's about a ten-minute walk .
Not at all .
No , You're got on the wrong bus . You can take a No . 22 bus at the University station and then transfer to a No . 83 bus at the railway station .
Good , if you ’ ll excuse me , I ’ ll go over the sheet right now .
I can tell you at a glance that your prices are much too high .
We only ask that your prices be comparable to others . That ’ s reasonable , isn ’ t it ?
The size of our order depends greatly on the prices . Let ’ s settle that matter first .
When I say your prices are much too high , I don ’ t mean they are higher merely by 2 or 3 percent .
To have this business concluded , I should say a reduction of least 10 percent would help .
I think you are as well - informed as I am about the market for chemical fertilizers . It ’ s unnecessary for me to point out that sup - ply exceeds demand at present and that this situation is apt to continue for a long time yet . May I suggest that you call your home office and see what they have to say ?
Oh , Thank you . I'm looking for the train station .
Right ? OK , got it .
Next left then right ? OK .
I said , ' Do you want me to help you ? '
Go three blocks and turn right . It's right there .
No . It'll only take about five minutes to walk .
Anytime .
Right . Then you may think that I am not fit for this job according to my educational background .
But I want to be a tour guide very much because I like traveling and meeting various kinds of people . So I took an evening course at the Tourism School of Beijing after graduation and I have gotten a qualification certificate .
Yes , I always enjoy being with a group of people and chatting with them .
A tourist guide must be responsible for arranging and coordinating tour activities , and offering service of transportation , accommodation , sightseeing , shopping and entertainment .
Hard but interesting , I think .
Yes , I usually guided foreign tourists around Beijing when I was in University .
Yes , I have learned a little French and Japanese as well .
Sorry , I don ’ t know the rule about punching .
Do we also need to punch out after work ?
How about the lunch break , Lucy ?
May I ask whether we need to work overtime ?
Let me see . We ’ ll try , but I ’ m not sure that we can remove it .
Any starch ?
I have a laceration on my left forearm .
I got hit by a car in an accident .
No , not much .
Will I need stitches ?
No , not really .
Thank you , doctor . Bye .
Ten to nine .
Don't cry over spilled milk , Fred ? Could you stay with me a few minutes ?
I just hate being alone at home with nothing to do about listen to the clock ticking.It ' s so lonely and boring . My sickness makes it worse . When will I recover ?
You only care about your work .
Stay just a few minutes longer , OK ?
Yes .
Thank you .
I'd like to reserve a double room . I will be arriving next Monday , the 12th . My name is Wilson .
Yes , that's right .
Three or four days , perhaps longer .
When it comes to that , I have a lot to say .
When I went back to my doctor to hear the results of my lab tests , I tried to keep a poker face even though I was scared to death . Then you guess what he said .
He told me the tests were negative and there was nothing wrong with me .
OK . There are five people in my family , Father , mother , elder brother , younger sister and I .
My brother has found his job and my sister is still in college .
My father is a middle school teacher .
My mother is a housewife .
I am not married yet and I live alone now .
No , my father and brother are doing that .
Yes , I have already graduated .
I love them , too . Let's move into the kitchen . Wait until you see the refrigerator .
And the stove is brand new . You know how to use a gas stove , right ?
It's better for cooking Chinese food . Well , what do you think ?
Perfect ! Couldn't be better .
It's just what I want .
I am really pleased with it .
It's super .
Yes , that's exactly what I need . How about terms for these ?
Is there any flexibility on that ?
OK . In my position , I think the best way to go would be for the 90 - day loan . That would give us a little more time to sort out the repayment plan .
All right . Please read it to me .
Very good .
Oh , that's great .
Sure , do you have the receipt ?
Ok . may I ask what is the reason for returning these products ?
I see , and what about the keyboard ?
I am sorry mam , but we can only exchange or refund defective products , we cannot take responsibility for misuse or damages .
Luckily we got the last two .
Gunpowder , compass , the paper making , and the printing .
May , I don't see why they are great . They are just simple things .
Milestones ? May , you must be kidding .
Well , I suppose the ancient inventors made a lot of money out of them .
Why ? Didn't you say that they were milestones ?
Well , their inventors were not as clever as Bill Gates .
I need some medicine .
My wife . She suffers from a bad cold .
Fever and a bad cough .
What kind of medicine does she need ?
How many pills for each time ?
Thank you very much .
Not at all . I ’ m an agnostic . do you ?
I think everything has a scientific explanation rather than a theological one .
I ’ m sure that science will explain everything eventually . I think that the strangest thing about religion is that so many religions people act in ways that their religion claims are wrong .
Religions preach tolerance , but many wars are caused by intolerant religious fanatics .
They're going skiing in Colorado .
You're probably right . Oh , what the heck ! I'll take it all ... in maroon , like you said .
I'm sick of it , too .
It's no use complaining . If we had got enough money , we couldn't put up with it , and would have moved out .
Is that Sue ?
A.This is George .
Yes , I once booked there . They give the immediate confirm information and flight information to both your mobile phone and e-mail . You can conveniently pay by credit card , so the whole transaction only takes a couple of minutes . They also provide e-tickets , meaning you don ’ t need to go to any office to pick an air ticket . You go to the airport directly and check in with your ID card .
Yes , therefore they are expanding the scope of their service . For example , hotels can be booked through the same site as well .
Hello sir , may I help you ?
Sure . Here it is .
50 dollars .
How about this one ? It's on sale for only 35 dollars .
How about the one next to the black gloves ? It's very similar to the one you like .
30 dollars .
Is this color OK , or would you like a different color ?
Do you need any more of these shirts ?
How many do you want ?
Hi , I am Liu Ming . I am calling to tell you that I have got the job .
I really feel grateful to you for your reference . They have mentioned this in the job interview .
Thanks again . I will start on next Monday . I am sure I will have good performance .
It's a big bedroom with a drawing room , facing a beautiful wood .
No , but there is one downstairs , which my daughter used some years ago .
Certainly , you're welcome anytime .
( after a while ) Good afternoon , Mrs . Smith . I called you just now .
Yes .
Wonderful ! A modest , comfortable room . Ah , a beautiful window , through which I can see a beautiful scene , and hear the birds singing . How nice !
Excellent ! I like it ! When can I move in ?
OK .
This is Mrs Smith . Can I help you ?
You are welcome . I am very impressed by your capability .
No , nothing . It's thoughtful of you to call me again .
Ok , I will . Do you have any question ?
Goodbye .
Hi . I was wondering what kind of fixed asset loans you have ? Do you have Fixed Asset Loans ?
That's a good idea , to familiarise myself with it . Then , I'll be back if we decide to go ahead .
That's what I am going to do .
I surely will . How much is this wood carving ?
That's OK . Is anything else recommended ?
I'd like to see some traditional arts .
Yes , I'm just here to pick out some special presents for my foreign friends .
Sounds good . I'll take paper-cut .
You collect them yourself ? I think that you are just doing the wholesale .
Wow , you are the expert on it .
I'd like to make a person-to-person call to Beijing , China . The number is 2135367 8 , and I want to speak to Mr . Zhang .
Yes , that's right .
My name is Luo Gang , and the phone number is 513-3284 .
What the number I gave you , operator ?
Oh , I'm sorry . should have been 2135-3668 , not 3678 . I've given you a wrong number .
Yes .
Thank you .
Yes , there're some samples in our office and you can take some to study it . Besides , you see , in recent years , we've visited a diversity of factory buildings all over the world and we hope that our building is the perfect match of advanced technology and attractiveness .
And please let white color dominate .
Oh ! I've almost forgot the location was transferred to the A county in the east of the city .
Well , the most important thing is that our company demand the quality be exactly the same as the sample which you'll take from the office on the third floor .
Thanks a lot . And I believe I'll have a good time working with you .
Bye !
That's no problem . Let me see ... You still have ten days annual leave left , is that right ?
That's long leave . How's your project coming along ?
Well , all right . But you make sure to tie up loose ends before you leave .
Great ! I hope you have a good relaxation and come back refreshed .
Only a few .
I've gotten six , I think .
Of course I have .
I think they're $ 130 .
I just got a parking ticket .
I'm going to pay it today .
I am typing a report for the moment , Mr . Robbins . Anything I need to do ?
Is it urgent ?
Ok , I am coming .
Yes , I have this time . But If I don't understand a word or a phrase when you are dictating , can I ask you halfway ?
All right . I understand now . Do you think I should leave a margin on every page wide enough for notes and amendments .
Certainly I will , Mr . Robbins . By the way , may I use a window envelope ?
You want the cards in alphabetical order using the last names ?
I got stuck in traffic again . There was a terrible traffic jam near the Carrefour intersection .
I don't think it can be avoided , to be honest .
I think it's something that I'll have to consider . The public transport system is pretty good .
I know . I feel bad about how much my car is adding to the pollution problem in this city .
The only problem is that I'm going to really miss having the freedom that you have with a car .
That's true . I could certainly use the exercise !
Yes , it's not good for me or for the environment .
I can take two thousand off . That'll make the rent twenty-eight thousand .
Sure , for at least three thousand per month .
I'm glad . Now , there's a deposit fee of two month's rent .
They'll be ready by this afternoon .
Is that right ? We're very sorry .
I'm afraid we can't return it by 11 o'clock .
Yes , we'll do so .
I want to effect payment under an L / C today .
That seems alright . What's the exchange rate like today ? Good or bad ?
I am here to have a discussion on your company's investment issue .
I am James Pond from FAM Company and I am here to discuss it with Nova .
Yes , I did it yesterday . Our meeting should be 2 pm .
Thank you .
Sure . May I take your measurements ?
I see , sir . Can you come back for a fitting on the 10th , that's in a week's time ?
Well , a business suit usually takes ten days ' time . But in your case , we'll try to have it ready sooner . How about coming for your fitting on the 8th ? Then your suit will be ready for you on the 10th ?
We're here today to present to you the results of our marketing research regarding the consumer behavior .
I am glad to see everyone is here and on time . Let's get started ! Susan , toss out some of your ideas .
Break it up ! I will not permit fighting in this campus .
exhaust fumes from vehicles cause a great deal of damage to the environment .
as much as I love this city , I think I'm going to have to find a greener city to live in . Living in a polluted city like this just can't be good for my health .
what is the greenhouse effect exactly ?
I see , so it's similar to global warming ?
I heard that some people in England are pleased with the fact that the climate is becoming warmer because it's making their towns a more pleasant place to live .
people always seem to make jokes as a way to deal with unfortunate situations .
Thank you . Yes , I would .
I guess I'll try a chocolate one first.Mmmm ... this is delicious.Are they hard to make ?
That does look easy . I think I'll make some tonight .
I'd like to buy a ticket to Casablanca on flight US125 tomorrow .
Well , I want to stay under $ 100 .
It ’ s easy grandpa . Insert you card into the machine here . Then wait a moment . Ok . Now you enter your PIN . It should have four numbers .
You really shouldn ’ t write it down . You should memorise it . You can change it to a more convenient number if you like .
Yes . Choose the service you need to use . If you choose to withdraw money , the machine will ask you how much you want .
That ’ s right . Give the machine a moment to process you request . Then take your money .
I am sorry , you have the wrong number .
Sure . Should I wash or dry ?
OK . Let's do it .
Yes , this week's issue just came in . Here it is .
Let me check ... yes , we got the October issue a few days ago . It's on that shelf over there .
Could you tell me my account balance ? My account number is ...
Emily Smith .
Thank you . I want to make a withdrawal of 150 dollars .
Thank you .
How long will you stay there ?
Where will you live during the vacation .
Have you made a reservation ?
That's OK .
Well , I go jogging every morning , eat a healthful diet and work out in a gymnasium twice a week .
Yes , I need to talk to him .
Thank you .
Yes , madam , how much would you like to remit ?
Which would you like to remit , by mail or by cable ?
The cable will take less time for your account , in the meantime , the regular service charge is also higher than that of the mail one .
OK , please fill in the application form giving the name and address of beneficiary , your name and telephone .
Everything is OK . The commission is 50 yuan .
Why ?
OK . You can change it .
No , I think it is very boring . Can you change it to Channel Twelve , please ?
Yeah , it's very funny . Have you ever watched it before ?
I'm sure you will like it .
As far as I know , the nearest one is next to the Willdon .
Yes , take the greyhound bus . It will lead you directly there .
How can we relate tiger to this spot , Miss Zhang ?
How ignorant I am !
I know that tea . It smells fragrant .
Janice , David , come here . We take some photos here . I can't imagine how beautiful it is !
Thanks .
No problem . Wait a moment .
I ’ m afraid he's not in .
Certainly . May I ask who ’ s calling , please ?
I'm not sure I can't agree , dan
Surely , there are other ways to save money .
Did you get the position you wanted ?
I'm glad to hear that . Congratulations !
Sure , but you really did great and outperformed the others . You deserved it !
It was nice to have you with us .
Not at all . It was a pleasure . Perhaps you will come out with us again while you are here .
Goodbye .
Good morning . I bought this vacuum here a few months ago . It doesn ’ t work now . Can I return it or get it fixed ?
Yes , I do .
Four months ago .
But the direction book says I will get one-year warranty .
Okay . I understand . I ’ ll call the Customer Service Office of the manufacturer . Thank you .
Let's see . If we have it , it should be over there under M . ( He looks through the Cds . ) Hmm , it looks like we've sold out of that one , but we should be getting some more copies in soon . If you want , we can order it for you .
Yes , it's right over here .
Back there against that wall .
No problem .
Of course , sir . Did you have anything from the minibar ?
Ok , the total would be $ 367 and 65 cents.How would you pay ?
Of course , sir . Will you need taxi ?
I am a graduate of a technical university and have been employed as a technician with Company or approximately 10 years .
I am looking for a growth opportunity , which I feel is not available at my current employer . In terms of skills , I am Microsoft certified in Windows XP and several other operating system
I see myself in a management position .
Yes , do you have sweaters ?
You have quite a range , haven't you ? I would like to see some other styles .
Again ?
Your clock never works . Perhaps you should buy a new one .
Thanks , Denise . Actually , I was really surprised . I mean , there were a lot of qualified people out there .
Thanks a lot . I expect to see your name nominated pretty soon , too . You ’ Ve been doing some great work !
They ’ re in the cabinet next to the sink .
They ’ re in the cabinet above the dishwasher .
They ’ re in that drawer .
No problem .
Yes , Todd , how nice to hear your voice !
I really enjoyed our evening together , Todd .
Hiking would be perfect ! May I bring along a picnic lunch for us to share ?
I'll work on the lunch , and you can work out the details of where we will go . What time will you be at my house ?
Nine is good . See you on Saturday !
I need some stamps for this letter .
How much do I need for this letter ?
I want it registered . How much is it then ?
Here's a 10 - dollar bill .
Thanks . Good-bye .
OK . What ?
You wouldn't do that . Would you ?
What about your accounts ?
Yes , I am wondering if I can join the sightseeing tour in your hotel .
4 persons altogether .
Thank you . Put the charge on my bills , please .
Yes , madam . May I help you ?
Fine , madam . When will Mr . Brent be arriving , and how many nights will he be staying ?
it's beautiful . Enjoy it while it lasts . It's supposed to get cold tomorrow .
it's supposed to snow early tomorrow morning and then tomorrow afternoon there's a chance of freezing rain .
do you have any plans for tomorrow ?
you might want to change your plans . With the cold and wet weather that we're supposed to have tomorrow , the roads are going to be rather slippery .
I just have to go to class tomorrow afternoon .
if that happens , then I'll invite you over and we can drink hot cocoa and watch movies .
hey , look outside ! It's started to drizzle !
Certainly . The product has a two-year guarantee . If it breaks down during that period we offer a replacement unit completely free of charge . Our products are very reliable but we recommend you take out an extended warranty . This covers you for a further two years .
It covers all parts and labour , except for normal wear and tear of course .
Our engineers are on call 24 hours a day . We guarantee someone will be with you within four hours , but in practice it's often much sooner .
Not really . It's a very comprehensive warranty . I ’ ll put a copy in the post to you and you can read through the small print .
No , nothing in particular .
As regards salary , I leave it to you to decide after experience of capacity .
Thank you , Mr . White . I really appreciate your assistance .
Yes , several times .
Not bad .
Then , why didn't you do that ?
Some of them , I think , are not good .
No , I mean some of them are not clean enough .
I judge by appearances .
It certainly is .
Don't try everything at one time , please .
Everything is gone , sir ?
Is there anything in particular you want ?
Got it . Anything else ?
Not a problem . Anything else ?
Someone will be up shortly with your order , sir .
I don't think you can . In China , our currency is not freely convertible yet .
No . You can go to the Bank of China to exchange some US dollars at the current exchange rate of the day you exchange them . The maximum amount you can exchange is $ 2,000 .
The only official way is to go to Bank of China .
That ’ s a big order , Jane . I am really swamped .
Right . Okay , let me see what I can do . How about 1:30 right after my lunch meeting ? It won ’ t take more than a half hour , will it ?
It ’ s because of my son . Dick keeps getting on my nerves
Yes , he used to be . But now he ’ s drifting off track .
Would you like butter or jam on your toast or do you just want it plain ?
Anything to drink ?
Ten more minutes , mom .
It's already 3 8 o'clock .
sure . i suppose you dance much .

Why not ? I'd love to do that .
Wow . Look at this . So delicate and beautiful . Did ancient Chinese people really wear them ?

Where do you think you have problems ?
You know , no one else who has been in that apartment has had a problem before .
I will fix these problems when I get around to it .

Thank you so much . I'll try and catch that .
Yes , I can also learn about the traffic condition through it .
So we should take the advantage of it .
Certainly ! The first thing is to be honest about how much time for you can devote to your pet . Dogs are very demanding . You need to take them for walks and they love to play . Cats , on the other hand , are more independent .
Unusual pet are often more expensive to keep . Is that a problem ?
We have those , but I only sell them to people I know well , for obvious reasons . How about a lizard ? I have some that are very brightly coloured , are not aggressive , and are easy to feed and look after .
Sure . Come over here . As you can see , I have a wide selection of species . They can live together , if you want lizards of different kinds . Do you have a favourite colour ?
You can feed them on various things . They will eat small pieces of meat , but I ’ d recommend insects . You can get them from your garden , but remember that lizards eat a lot insects . I sell them here .
That ’ s fine . You shouldn ’ t make a hasty decision when choosing a pet .

Honey , just turn down the stove .
Yes , I live in that house with my parents and my sister .
Do you take your dog for a walk every day ?
And I take the dog for a walk every Wednesday , Thursday and Friday .
On Saturday we all go to the park and the dog comes with us .
My mum and my sister do the housework and cooking but I clean my room .
Yes indeed . It has a very strict inspection so it takes a pretty long Be for everyone .

We can complete a trade by email , electronic data interchange and smart cards , and so on .
Firstly , it can overcome the geographic limitation . And secondly , e-commerce can lower the internal costs . And thirdly , people like us , can also open stores on Internet .
Yes , one last thing . How much holiday time do you give your employees every year ?
How about sick days ?
Any other benefits ?
Great . Thanks so much for your time .
I'd like a trim .
No , thanks .
Cut it short in the front , but leave it long in the back . Leave just a little over the ears .
Thank you .
Only as a clerk in a store .

Thank you .
I will join John in his mountaineering trip .
We haven't made up our minds . Will you come with us ?
I am.What can I do for you ?
Very good , you majored in International Trade ?
Well , for this position , we prefer experienced employees , Those who have just graduated from university , they are supposed to start by working as an intern for at least half a year .
Good.That is the kind of man we are looking for.By the way , do you like traveling ? Our sales representatives need to travel a lot .
Are you willing to work for extra hours ?
What about next Monday ?
Well , see you next monday .
It will be held on October 15th .
You'd better be early in case that you may be late because of traffic jam . That will put you in a insurmountable place .
It's a bit too large . Would you please shorten the sleeves ?
Besides , can you take up the hem one inch ?
I used to hold a similar job for six years .
I think so .
Please I'd like a ticket to New York .
No , early saturday morning .
Nothing earlier ? I prefer flight at nine thirty .
No , exactly not
Sounds not good . I won't take it .
Well . We only accept the payment to be made by confirmed and irrevocable L \ C , payable against shipping documents .
I'm afraid not . That is our usual practice , because we are sure we will get the right amount of money that way .
We would like to do it in accordance with an F . O . B .
I need to file a complaint .
I got robbed .
It happened this morning .
My wallet and cell phone .
I sure did .
That shouldn't be a problem .
Sure , Johnny , how much do you need ? five bucks ?
I don ’ t know about that.with all the uncertainty in the markets right now , it would be a very unwise decision to invest . I don ’ t know if you ’ re aware son , but there has been a lot of turmoil in the markets recently . There have already been half a million layoffs in the last few months , and we have no idea how the proposed stimulus package will impact the economy . There ’ s just too much instability . I wouldn ’ t feel comfortable investing in this climate .
Come on , son , you ’ re looking at this too naively , the Chinese market has exhibited a great deal of instability , and their currency has been devalued by almost a whole percentage point .
Well in total we have around 150 employees based in Hong Kong with another 400 in our head office in Beijing . The news desk staff in Hong Kong comprises around 80 staff .
Well , as you know Rebecca , in journalism work hours are not exactly nine to five . You could be on call at any time . We do have to work very unsociable hours at times .
Good , as long as you understand that .
Yesterday ! But no , we are hoping to start from the beginning of next month .
Well , since we are getting up so late , I decided to make a big breakfast !
Kind of , so I made scrambled and soft boiled eggs , some french toast and buttermilk pancakes !
Yeah , just the way you like it ! I also put out some cereal and muesli if you feel like having something more light .
Get the jam and butter while you are in there ! Oh ! And don ’ t forget the syrup !
Em , it's delicious !
You're lucky .
I have learned English for 10 years , and I have passed College English Test Band 4 and 6.My spoken English is fairly good enough to express myself fluently .
I did self-study of Japanese in college , and I can carry on some simple conversations in Japanese .
I learned from your ad.That you will provide on-the-job training for new employees.This is just what I need , because I'm a recent college graduate . I have the necessary knowledge and skills but I lack experience .
I want to prove my true value in the electronic industry , and hopefully in the near future I would be promoted to a higher position .
No , don't try to tempt me . I'm becoming chubby , and I have to slim down .
I don't think so . I know I've put on weight this winter .
Yes , to tell you the truth . I am on a diet .
I had been doing quite well . In all subjects , I got excellent scores .
Yes , I was the top student among my classmates .
Quite well . I took the National English Speaking Contest in CCTV 2008 and I got first place .

All right , sir . They should be ready for you by tomorrow afternoon .
It's our pleasure .
So I am .
I got it last week .
It's valid for 5 years . I am planning to do a doctor ’ s degree during my stay there .
Thank you very much .
It's nice to meet you . Thanks for coming .
I wanted to meet with you to discuss your daughter .
Not at all . She's a joy to have in my class .
She is absolutely wonderful .
No . She is actually very intelligent and well behaved .
You have nothing to worry about with her .
Can we have two adjoining double rooms , sir ?
I'm afraid not .
We prefer on the same floor because we will probably chat late at night .
What is it like ?
That's great ! How much is it ?
That's fine .
Alright , hanks .
Do you take traveler's checks ?
Yes , please .
Fine , thank you for coming . Mr . Wu , Please take a seat . I am Anne Smith , the assistant manager .

Are their cards free , too ?
I think it ’ s great ! I really like the color , and it goes really well with your eyes . I ’ Ve actually been eyeing that dress at Maxine ’ s for a while now , but I wasn ’ t sure I could afford ninety-five dollars for a dress at the moment .
Yes , that ’ s the price they were advertising it at . I was hoping it might go on sale soon . Why , how much did you pay for it ?
Of course ! Everything at Helen ’ s is overpriced , and they sell things that you can find at almost every other clothing store ! Why didn ’ t you shop around ?
Yes , a very long time .
I'm here on vacation .

Thank you very much .
Very interesting . Thank you for bringing it to us .
We haven't decided yet , we will let you know if we do .
I was nervous at that time . What about you ?
We can have a rest now after this tough interview .
Sounds like a good idea . And I think this can leave deep impression to HR . How can we write a suitable letter ?
I am getting to know your meaning .
When you made your appointment , what day did you choose ?
At what time was that appointment ?
I can see the appointment that you had . What day do you need to change to ?
What time would you prefer ?
I will put you down for that time . Thank you for calling to reschedule .
En , I am looking for a porter , do you know where I can find one ?
What's the charge ?
Thank you .
Yes , not bad . Like turn your cell phone ringer off and find a private place to make calls which it ’ s showing your respect to your co-workers .
Well , this one is not compulsory . It is just suggestion .
It's a difficult choice.The train is a little faster , but much more expensive .
Buses are more cramps and you can't walk around .
Really ? I think you see more traveling by train .
I prefer going by train , even though it costs more .
The trains aren't usually full.We can get them on the day we travel.We should buy return tickets , because they are much cheaper than getting 2 singles .
No , what ?
Get out of here ! I didn ’ t even know they were dating !
Well , I'm not too happy about it .
Well , I'm afraid it's not at all what I wanted . You haven't really followed my instructions.It ' ll have to be done again .
oh , yes . I want to check whether you still have any vacancies . I need three single rooms for next Monday .
yes , please . Do you take credit cards ?
and how about Internet access ?
is it available in the rooms ?
that's OK . Is breakfast included ?
fantastic . Thank you very much .
You should ask for a holiday and relax yourself for a little bit . You worked so hard .
Call me John . This is a great area of the city for shopping . There ’ s a grocery store just around the corner .
Well , the Riverside Mall has 200 stores in it , including four major department stores .
Yes , on 4th street , near the movie theater there are many specialty shops , including clothing boutiques .
Yes , it ’ s a really nice neighborhood .
Oh , no , Nathan , I ... I really think we've bought this flat at the right time , you know.Market prices are going to go up , and I think you'll find in a year or two it will be worth a lot more .
But don't you like this place ? I remember when we came to see it we thought it would be lovely .
Oh , why didn't you say so then ? But I still think we've made a good buy .
More or less . There's just one thing bothering me .
Well , you know I have some students studying for their master's degree . One of them tried to give me a gift that kinda made me uneasy .
It's an Egyptian carpet . The student came to my office the other day and brought the carpet to show his gratitude . Seeing what gift was , I was really uncomfortable . I mean it's too expensive a gift for a student to give a professor . I don't think I've done anything to deserve that gift , so I refused it .
I know , but I really can't accept such an expensive gift . I explained to him why , but he seemed really upset about it . I think he might have taken it the wrong way .
That's what I am worried about . I do understand the respect attached with the gift and I am honored . But I really don't think it's proper for a student to spend a fortune on a gift for a professor . I think we need to have a talk to make sure we are on the same page .
We have no pool , sir , but we do have swim stations in our gym .
You know how you run on a treadmill but don't go anywhere ? Well , it's the same thing .
The stations are absolutely free to guests , sir .
The swim stations are open daily from 7 a . m . to 10 p . m .
Be warned , sir . At certain hours the swim stations are very crowded .
OK . Here is my application form and all the documents .
Because I want to have a view of the exotic landscapes to extend my views and understanding of the world .
Myself .
Yes . Everything is ready .
Dear friends . Here , I wish to say a word of thanks for holding this send-off party for me . Actually I didn't expect at all for this . I owe a lot to all of you here . It's been 5 days since I came to visit here . Time really flies . I feel grateful for your welcome and help in the five days . I will miss you while I am leaving . Let's keep in touch in any way . What's more , to the success of our face-to-face meeting , to the upcoming cooperation of our two companies , bottom up !
Madam , we also welcome you to visit our company . I hope you can also bring your family there to have a look of our company . In this way , we will know each other better .
I have time to speak with you . Where would you like to purchase your house ?
How many bedrooms and bathrooms do you need ?
Do you need to be located in a particular school district ?
Is a view important to you , or would you rather be located on a lakeshore lot ?
Thank you for all of the information . I will help you find the perfect house for you .
Would you like anything else ?
All right . And do you want to separate bills or just one single bill ?
Here is your bill . It comes to 80 yuan . And yours is 60 yuan .

I'll pass on the soup , but I'd like a garden salad .
Yes , I'd like a glass of iced tea .
Thank you .
My present pay is 100,000 Yuan per year .
I like to be paid more than that . Hopefully , 120,000 Yuan per year .
I think you'll find I'm worth that .
Yes , it is quite reasonable .
Yes , sir.Just a minute , please , I'll check with the kitchen .
We have an appointment in half an hour .
Do you have anything else I can have instead ?
I'll take beef stew , then .
Congratulations , Bob ! That ’ s great news , what ’ s her name ?
That ’ s a pretty name . Give your wife my best !
You can find one at the end of the street .
No.but there are quite many cars .
I'm sorry , but she won't have any openings until 11:00 , unless there's a cancellation .
Yes , she's free then .
You should go to the dentist .
Well , suffer then . If you have a toothache , you have to go to the dentist .
Stop being such a baby . If it really hurts that much , just let them knock you out .
Good . You feel better after you do .
Amalgamated Trading Company . It's Swiss . Don't you think working at a foreign company would be glamorous ?
Well , it's small , but it's a young , dynamic , rapidly-growing company with a progressive , humanistic philosophy .
Four times . I'm totally prepared . Oh , no ! I forgot to take off my nail polish ! And I have to be there in 15 minutes ! That's it . I blew it .
But the competition is fierce this year ... and it seems like I'm the only one left who hasn't found a job .
I'm sorry , hold on a moment . I'll check it out . But we have already shipped it to you last month . Would you like us to contact the express company to know what's going on ?
Ok , I am terribly sorry for the trouble you are getting into.We will contact you first thing , once we know the reason .
What are you going to cook ?
A teriyaki bowl sounds nice .
All you need to make it is white rice and some teriyaki beef .
The first and simplest thing you have to do is make some white rice .
Then you should shred your beef and pour some teriyaki marinade over it .
Then all you need to do is cook it and enjoy .
You need all your receipts for reimbursement .
Yes , here is the form for an expense report . Fill it out and give it to me . I ’ ll get it signed for you .
Can I speak to Miss Cooper please ?
Engaged . Oh , dear ! Could you tell her it's a long-distance call ?
How long do you think she'll be ?

Can you tell her I'm waiting to speak to her ?
Thank you very much .
Wait a moment . Here you are .
Sure .
Sure . What's it , Yvonne ?
Okay , you take one end and I'll take the other .
Hello . I hope you can help me ; I'm a little worried about my new card .
I received my new card this morning , but I'm unable to use it .
No , it's right here , see ? The ATM will not accept it !
Yes . I was told it would be activated and ready to use right away . So , what's gone wrong ?
Well , that explains it . I've been using my old PIN number ! Thanks for explaining everything to me .
Why not ? See .
Oh , great ! It's delicious . You see , I am already putting on weight . There is one thing I don't like however , MSG .
According to some studies it may cause cancer .
I just happen to have a question for you guys . Why do the Chinese cook the vegetables ? You see what I mean is that most vitamin are destroyed when heated .
It was a nightmare .
Actually , the business trip itself was very successful . We arrived on time , we had nice conversations and we settled some important issues for the next year .
Well , the air line lost my luggage on the return flight and then I lost my carry on bag when I was tackling with the officers in charge . I left the airport three hours later than I expected and then I was caught in a traffic jam . When I finally got home , I was totally exhausted . But I found the elevator was out of service due to a blackout .
I am still waiting for their call .
Yes , could you put me in the no-smoking section ?
If one's available , please . But not over the wing .
Good morning . This is Paul Alexander calling from the Isis Advertising Firm . We need a car to the airport for Mr . Phillips .
Let me check ... His flight ’ s at 2:30 p . m . , so he should leave no later than 12 noon .
Can you tell me which credit card it was for ?
You should've gotten that bill two weeks ago .
The computer is showing that all bills have been mailed .
Maybe you should call your post office .
Yes , but you will need to send us proof of their mistake .
Not a problem . Enjoy the rest of your day .
Yes . It's a feast of eyes to walking in the museum .
What a shame that we can't take pictures .
I really would rather just listen . Isn't there anyone else who wants to sing ?
I know , but ... Hey , Stanley's here ! I've been wanting to hear him sing all night .
I'll put the song at the front of the list .
Oh , you are so efficient . I thought you might give it to me tomorrow . Thanks .
This is encouraging news , good for you ! What is your solution , then ?
Sounds not bad ! Better performance isn ’ t just about doing a lot more . It is about focusing on the right things to do .
Fine , just fine.How about you ?
Thank you , Mr . Cooper . I hope we get the contract .
Pork chops .
I think I caught a cold .
Runny nose and coughing .
I have just taken the temperature , I don't think so .
Are you sure ?
What should I do ?
It should be close to the university . Neither of us are good at getting up in the mornings and closer it is , the later we can get up .
Neither am I . so a small place is ok , but we'll get a bigger one if it's not expensive . Do you mind if it's in a noisy area .
Good point . Ok , let's go to the estate agent and see what they can offer us .
How much do you think the rent will be ?
Well , is it possible for you to effect shipment by the middle of June ?
Yes , I did some part-time jobs such as English tutor , salesman , and model .
I learned to be patient , professional and gained a ll of experience of direct sales .
Well , since we are getting up so late , I decided to make a big breakfast !
Kind of , so I made scrambled and soft boiled eggs , some french toast and buttermilk pancakes !
Yeah , just the way you like it ! I also put out some cereal and muesli if you feel like having something more light .
Get the jam and butter while you are in there ! Oh ! And don ’ t forget the syrup !
Yes . Flight DB117 departs at 5:38 pm and arrives in New York at 6:00 am with a layover in Chicago . It also makes a refueling stop at Colombia .
Sorry sir , it is the only flight wa have right now .
Would you turn off the tap ?
Then will you put all the towels under the bathroom door ?
I'll have our housekeeper come right away .
When you woke up , the water was coming out of the tub .
No thanks . I'm full . We need to find our waitress and get our bill .
This waitress has really been on top of things , hasn't she ?
OK , let's see what the damage is . The total for our meal is $ 36.00 .
Fifteen percent is a normal tip , but she really did a great job . What do you think about 20 % this time ?
Her tip will end up being $ 7.20 plus the bill of $ 36.00 . The total will be $ 43.20 .
I agree . Maybe we can come back again next week .
Would you like me to go with you ?
Do you want to type that letter ?
Do you want to tell her ?
What crime did I commit ?
I am innocent .
Well , let's see . Why don't we go dancing for a change ? We haven't done that for a long time .
Hmm . Well , in that case , we could go to the movies .
Well , do you have any suggestions ?
It's OK with me , but we don't have any beer and things .
OK .
Good night , mum .
Yes . How do I get an outside line , please ?
No , thanks a lot . I'll try it myself .
This go-around we're focusing on new moms , families with median income and one or more children under the age of two .
Well , there are some similarities that come up . Because both groups are made up of mothers ... so as before , we can play up on maternal instincts , hygiene , safety , along those lines . But that being said , there are some specific differences that come into play because we are dealing with mothers of infants here .
Demographics say an average age of 28.7 , educational background of university or post-grad , annual household income of 40-50 K a year .
Yes , sir , I'll be there in just a moment .
Gosh sir , thank you , sir ! I had no idea there were any positions opening up in our department .
Management ? Wow , I had no idea I could move so quickly from entry level to managerial staff .
I am returning something that I bought yesterday .
I'm returning a cellphone .
It's defective .
It keeps turning off on it's own .
I have it right here .
Thanks for your help .
Dear , let ’ s drop the subject .
Good morning . I'd like to cash this check .
What about the driving license ?
I am sorry . I only have my driving license with me .
Thank you . Here you are .
Would you give me some in twenties and tens ?
All right .
Yes , here's my ID card .
What ? What did you buy ?
What is it ? Why did you buy a brick ?
And ?
And it's a brick ?
I can't believe how stupid you are . Why didn't you open the box ?
So he had the boxes wrapped in plastic .
But why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars ?
Aha ! Now I understand.You were trying to buy stolen goods on the sidewalk.So , what I think is , you deserve to get cheated !
That's no problem.He just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap . That's easy.And probably it's the same shop he got the boxes from.Maybe his friend works in an electronics store . They sell video cameras there.Probably they had a couple video camera boxes lying around.So they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like you.Twenty dollars a brick . That's a good profit if they can sell enough bricks .
Hey doc . Well , I think I might need glasses . I ’ m getting headaches , and I really struggle to see things that are far away . But I have always had 20/20 vision .
Mmm .. . X , E , R , 3 , a question mark , and I can ’ t quite make out the other symbol but I think it ’ s the peace sign .
Yeah , I know , my vision is really blurry at times .
Thanks doc !
No thanks . I'm full . We need to find our waitress and get our bill .
The service this evening has kind of sucked . Is that our server over there ?
Good . I'll just stay here until you get back .
How much of a tip do you think our waitress deserves ?
I kind of feel the same way , but they may have just been really short-staffed tonight .
$ 3.60 will be the right amount for the tip .
Let me see what's available .
Africa Airline 551 leaves at 9:00 pm .
Take a guess .
Very likely . You have a slight fever . Do you have a headache , too ?
Well , you have to let your flu run its course . You must stop working and stay in bed to get plenty of rest . Usually it will take 4 to 6 days to make a full recovery .
Maybe you'll have to cancel it or postpone it . If you go out while you are sick , it won't help you recover . You may even pass your disease on to others .
No , thanks . I'm fine .
If that's what you want to do , then we can .
I'm buckled up . What's next ?
What do you want me to do ?
How far should I go ?
Tell me before you want me to stop .
Thanks . Let's go driving again tomorrow .
I ’ m making a deposit today .
I would like to deposit a check .
Okay . Here you go .
Yes , I would .
Let me get $ 150 back .
Thank you . Have a good one .
Are you on a tourist visa or a student visa ?
What is the reason for extension ?
We ’ ll need a letter from your university and a financial statement from you .
I absolutely love the apartment .
I do have one problem with the apartment .
I don ’ t like all those stains in the carpet .
I did not know that .
That was the only thing that I saw wrong with the apartment .
It ’ s absolutely incredible . I ’ ll take it .
Good morning .
No , thank you . I just had two cups of coffee at my desk .
Yes , it keeps me going . Sometimes I think I'm addicted .
No , I've tried them . But I'm not really a smoker .
I wanted to set up this meeting with you to discuss a little proposal .
It is about the staff meetings.You know how we have a staff meeting every Tuesday .
Well , I have been thinking about it.And I believe we could do things more efficiently here .
The way it is now , the staff from all four branches get together once a week.We meet for one hour . But I think a lot of time is wasted in transportation .
Yes . Some people spend half of the morning on the road .
I think they are important too.That ' s why I want people to have a better attitude about them .
Here's what I propose . I think we should meet once every two weeks , but meet for ninety minutes or more .
I also think the meetings should be more focused.And I would be willing to take responsibility for that .
No , not really run them . But I could help organize them . I could discuss meeting topics with you , and then prepare a schedule for each meeting . I could then send an e-mail to all the staff to explain the coming meeting.This way the meetings would become more focused , and people would prepare better .
I really think it would work.The meetings could be longer , and better organized .
Excellent . I would be happy to get started on it .
Sure . How about this one ?
Yes . We have both the paperback and the hardcover .
The hardcover is more expensive .
I would like the round-way ticket to Shanghai on December 10th .
What's the departure time ?
Well , the afternoon will be fine .
First class will be preferred .
My name is Janice . Well , I book this ticket for Nova , the marketing manager of Pineapple Computer Company . Where can I get the flight ticket ?
I can ’ t stand up ! My stomach is killing me !
It hurts smack in the middle of my gut !
I felt OK until an hour or so ago , and then I just doubled over .
No , and I don ’ t usually get a lot of stomachaches .
I think that that is the best way to figure out what is causing this . Thank you .
Yes , I would like to exchange some money .
I would like to exchange Chinese RIB for American dollars . Do you accept $ 100 bills ?
Well , that depends on the rate . How much is the RIB trading at today ?
I guess , here , give me 5,000 RIB worth . I might as well exchange a little extra . Who knows what the exchange rate will be tomorrow !
Next week , it ’ s going to be quite a shock for him !
You bet . I wouldn ’ t miss it !
I'm sorry . Mr.Huang is quite busy right now . Could I pass him the message ?
Let me see . He's free from 3:00 to 4:30 tomorrow afternoon . Can you make it then ?
You're quite welcome . Thank you for calling . Bye-byeB
Don't rush , behave yourself please ! Let the people get off first .
But , if we all pushed our way in , nobody could get off , and nobody could get in either .
There are four more stops .
What's wrong ? You are like a little monkey , on pins and needles !
No , not on the train , but in the station .
Well , that is a question . You want to offer a suggestion ?
I guess you'll never forget today .
Lamb and beef . It will get even tastier when we add the veggies !
So ?
You'll be OK . It's just a little bit ...
I would like to sign up for some classes .
I need to take a driver's course .
What do I need to make an appointment for ?
All right , can I make an appointment right now ?
Can I make it for tomorrow at 9
Thanks a lot . I'll be there tomorrow .
Hello . Is Mr . Stewart there ?
I ’ m calling from Bell Canada . We are currently offering a great deal on long distance calling , only $ 17 a month . With this plan you get 500 minutes of long distance calls each month without any additional charges .
Okay . Thanks .
Yes sir . How can I help you ?
OK . And anything else I can do for you ?
Sure .
No problem , sir . Just tell me your name , phone number , and date of reservation .
Okay , sir , let me hit the delete button , and your reservation will be cancelled .
Not at all .
We can print as many as you like . Just tell me how many .
Here's a form to get you started .
I think you'll be very pleased with how well we duplicate your old card .
Thanks . Come back here next Wednesday to pick up your order , please .
If you don't mind paying a little extra , it's absolutely no problem .
No , there's no such section . The dairy section is where you'll find milk and cheese .
That's where you'll find things like salt and pepper .
Let's go to aisle 4 to pick up some pasta for tonight .
And let's get a loaf of bread at the bakery for breakfast .
I'll put the shopping basket back .
All except the back door . I left that open for Tim . He took the dog for a walk .
Okay . I'm going to stay up a while . I've got to go over the household budget . We're a little overspent this month .
Okay . Good night . See you at breakfast .
I feel kind of stupid .
We got lost coming back . I guess I don't really know this town yet .
No . We took a wrong turn somewhere.And Joseph doesn't know the town at all . So I started giving him directions.But I didn't really know where we were . So we got seriously lost .
I know I could have . But finally we asked someone where we were .
Guess where we ended up .
When we finally decided to ask someone , they told us we were in Grangerfield .
I don't know.The person we asked had to give us directions to the highway to get back here .
I know it is . I don't know how it happened .
What ?
How ?
Oh , that's what you think , huh ?
Yes , thanks .
It's very good . How do you make it ?
This salad looks so nice-just right for a hot day .
You Americans usually have nutritious food .
We use different spices but few people use recipes . They learn to cook by experience .
Do you realize that all these shoes are half off ?
Yes , but the offer only lasts this week .
Yes , I used to have a part-time job in advertising company .
I mostly did advertising planning .
I think an advertising planner should have active thoughts , creative talent , and be sensitive to the changes in the market .
The most important thing I learned was that I must continuously improve my abilities . Advertising is a constantly evolving trade and creativity is an important fact in success . If I want to make in marking in advertising history , I can ’ t stop studying and creating .
Oh , honey , I'm so sorry , we don't have enough space for you to have your own room .
Honey , you can ask him to be quite . Otherwise you may punish him and tell him to stand out of the room , right ?
I've got a terrible pain in my stomach , Doctor .
It started yesterday . I didn't eat any supper .
I think so . I feel very hot .
I've got an awful headache , too , and my throat hurts .
Is it serious ?
How often must I take it ?
Thank you , Doctor.Goodbye .
Just a moment and I'll check . We ’ re expecting a delivery on Friday . We've only got ten in stock at the moment . I can deliver those by first thing tomorrow morning . There'll be an extra charge for special delivery . I'll have to send them by courier .
I don ’ t want to .
Certainly not .
Turn on the radio ? What for ?
Listen to some music ? And who ’ ll cook dinner ? Will you ?
To a disco ? Oh , no . You know I hate pop .
Yes . Can I deposit valuables here ?
OK .
Would you tell me the rate per day for depositing my bag ?
When does the cloakroom close ?
Oh , dear ! I won't be back until about 11:30 tonight . Where can I pick up my bag ?
I see . Thanks a lot .
Sure .
6 hours . If you are in a hurry we can develop it in 3 hours .
I think my husband has some .
That ’ s true . If something happened to my husband , I might lose everything . Both of us have to work to keep our home , car , and our children ’ s education . I can ’ t afford that by myself .
Certainly .
Yes , millions of travelers come here every year for the view of the buildings .
We will visit the Statue of Liberty as scheduled .
Yes ?
Sure . There ’ s a lot here in this pamphlet .
Take the subway . It ’ s $ 1.50 per ride . You can buy a petrol card at the station .
My pleasure .
First , you fill out the application form and then we'll issue you a passbook .
No , Even a dollar is all right.Here ' s your passbook , sir ; just sign your name on it .
It varies from time to time.At present it is 6 % .
By all means.But you have to deposit enough money before you can write out your checks .
Well , I had a blood test last week . The doctor said that I have high blood pressure and my blood is thick and sticky . I'm very worried .
I have to admit it's easier said than done .
But you know I'm just not into exercises . And I wouldn't have time for exercises , either .
Actually , my doctor said the same thing .
Oh . I am sorry . I was busy looking for some whisky.Can you tell me the exactly place where I can find any ?
Do you have anything to declare ?
What's in the bag ? Would you mind opening the bag ?
NO . You don't have to pay duty on personal belongings .
Working under pressure is exciting and challenging . I don ’ t mind working under pressure . I work well under that circumstance . People can , I can .
No , nothing in particular .
I need about two to three weeks for necessary formalities . I will quit then transfer to your company .
I think I have a piece of apple pie .
Coffee would be fine .
Hope it all goes well . We're very busy at the moment and certainly don't want any problems at this time of year .
It wasn't me .
Could you tell me what Ants on the Tree is please ?
Sounds nice . I'll have that please .
Hi Angie , it ’ s Tom Reynolds here . Can you tell me if my tuition fees for this semester have been approved ?
Oh wow ! Thanks a million , Angie !
Good morning , sir !
Thank you , sir .
My name is Du Tao , number 3 .
Du Tao . D-U for Du and T-A - 0 for Tao .
I was born on January 1st , 1988 . I ’ m 20 years old now .
I ’ m living at Room 222 , Building 18 , N . P . U .
Gladly , 8962105 2 .
Yes . I'm looking for an apartment , I'd like two bedrooms .
My name's Donald Eakins .
It's E-A-K-I-N-S .
It's 1446 Pine Street .
Yes , it is .
Yes , I did . But when I got home , my son put it on and we found the hole .
Thank you very much .
All I need is your name , phone , and reservation date .
Randolph , Rudy . Let me hit one button , sir , and now your reservation is cancelled .
It's been my pleasure to help you .
No , I didn't .
I'm not sure where they sell bus passes at .
Where should I go ?
I had no clue that I could get it there .
Thanks for letting me know .
I'm going to go and get it right now .
Well , if you want to look professional , serious and more conservative , a blue dress , white shirt and not-too-high shoes would be the best choice . But sometimes , very formal clothes will keep you at a distance from your colleagues . It depends on the company ’ s dress code .
Whatever you choose , make sure they are neat and clean .
Certainly , but will it take long ?
OK . I'll look after it then .
Yes , how do I get to your shop from Chilin ?
Thank you very much .
How about two inches ?
I think that will over-process your hair , you should wait at least two weeks .
Great . My assistant will wash your hair , and then I'll be back to help you .
How can there be a traffic jam on a 16 - lane highway every day ?
I wonder if there was an accident .
Well , let ’ s put on some music . We ’ re going to be stuck in this for a while .
How about some Beatles ?
Yes , Ms . Rodriguez ? How can I help you ?
Absolutely . I ’ Ve been wanting to meet with you about that . Let me just get my book .
I did , Mom .
Sorry , you have the wrong number . There ’ s no Brian here .
No , it ’ s 777-9344 ?
That ’ s OK .
Excuse me , ma'ma . Could you walk back through the doorway again , please ?
Airport security . Could you empty your pockets over here , please ?
Ah , a set of keys .
That's all right . Enjoy your flight .
I'm not feeling well . I think I'm having a cold .
Yeah , I will .
Oh , sorry . Cross my fingers .
Where are we going ?
Do you have a washer down there ?
That's so convenient . Where are the dirty clothes ?
But I didn't see you carry them down .
Oh , hi , Mary , come on in . Any problem ?
Great . I forgot to ask you , though . How long did you want the place ?
Oh , well , that might be a problem . I usually only sign one year leases .
Well , if it ’ s not a problem . Then here you go .
Of course .
Yeah , and don ’ t worry about the security deposit . If everything ’ s all right when you move out , you ’ ll get it back .
Yes . Thanks . You can move your stuff in tomorrow .
Yes , the bookshop is just around the corner.Turn left and you ’ ll see the bookshop .
Right , if you see the bookshop , you can see the hospital .
Not at all .
Yes . Who is speaking ?
Oh , Kelly , I couldn't recognize your voice . Well , I'm fine .
Excuse me , I couldn't quite hear you . This line is crossed . Can you speak louder , please ?
Much better . I will definitely go to the airport to meet you .
Goodbye .
Yes . Everything's all set .
We're supposed to be meeting alone .
Fine . But no one else , OK ?
Really , it's so beautiful .
You mustn't pick it in this place .
It's a private garden .
110 pounds .
No , you know I can't bear eating less .
I've quit it already . I go to aerobics class everyday instead .
You see . I've lost my weight in spite of my good appetite .
I don't think so . You look full of energy every day . Time has stood still with you .
What happened to you ? You look like you got hit by a tornado !
You mean at the mall ? Was there a sale ?
Cool !
Hello , Mr . Henderson what can I do for you ?
OK , I can have it ready by the end of the week .
OK , I can have it ready tomorrow afternoon , but this suit is also very stained . I can ’ t guarantee we can remove it completely .
Certainly .
Every five minutes .
It comes on the dot .
Thanks . It ’ s nothing special actually .
Oh , it was nothing . Anyone could have done it . I still have a lot to learn yet .
Thank you . I won ’ t let this promotion change me .
Calm down , sir . What's your name and where are you now ?
Sir , leave the house if the fire draws any closer to your house . Our men will be over in 5 minutes .
Of course ! It is the No . 1 stressor in my life . You know job stress has become a very common problem these days . So we must learn to cope with it .
Well , there are two causes of job stress . One is employee characteristic and the other is company condition . So if we want to manage job stress , both we and the companies should do something . For me , I am trying to balance work and leisure time . You know , all work and no play make Jack a dull boy .
It is necessary . Positive attitude helps to prevent stress .
I heard some companies are providing stress management training and making changes inside them , like avoiding unrealistic deadlines and organizing relaxation activities . Our boss is a smart person . He will be learning from that if he would like to an efficient and healthy team .
Yes , what can I do for you ?
What's in it , please ?
OK . please fill in this form and label it .
Yeah . And would you like to mail it by air ?
Thirteen yuan , please . Here is the receipt and change .
You are welcome .
Oh right ... you know , my friend Eric is a DJ . Maybe he would like to play with us .
Well , I don't know , but we can find out . We can talk to him and ask if he wants to join our group .
Yes . When do you want it ?
Yes , sir .
Sorry , sir . You have to pay by yourself .
I'm not sure , but I think It's open until 4 o'clock .
It's a quarter past three .
There are many stores selling handcrafts in Paris . Our store is wellknown for vase , table wear and jewelry boxes . You can take your time and choose whatever you like .
You have made an excellent choice , it is our newcomer . The tapestry is on hot sell with the design and quality . The design on it is traditional Paris architecture .
100 frances .
We have a piece of table clothing to go with it . It is a brocade one with pretty stars .
You are right .
OK . Do you like these candles ? They are on sale now .
Don't you like it ?
I think it's a basketball match on channel 5 .
Well , I'd rather see a movie .
' Star war ' .
Yes , you're right .
Are you from a domestic flight or an international one ?
In that case , you should go to the baggage hall over there .
Yeah , that was close .
Yes ?
Sure . You just walk down this hallway . The copy room is the second room on the right .
What symptoms does he have ?
How long did the convulsion last ?
Does he have any other complaints ?
Have you taken his temperature ?
Let me examine him to see if there is any rash . No rash .
No , it is not meningitis . Just a high fever and convulsions , which results from a virus upper respiratory tract inflection .
No . No need for admission . I'll give the baby analgia nose drops to bring down the temperature first . Then I will give you a prescription . The pink tablets are used for his fever . When his temperature is over 38 ° C , give him one tablet . The other tablets are sedatives for his convulsions . The white liquid is for the cold . Give the baby plenty of water to drink .
Sure . I thought people only showed off pictures of their new babies , not new pets !
I see what you mean . He ’ s really cute . How old is he ?
Ok , let ’ s start opening some presents !
This next one is from Betty .
One more from Carla .
OK , that ’ s all of them . No more gifts . Now who wants to guess when the baby is due ?
I always love skiing . You know , it's a cool game for cool people . Stay with me and you will be cool , too .
Sure . It's probably the skiing show . Adam told me there were many skiing clubs whose members put on shows to attract more visitors .
Hey , don't be so pathetic . It's a maximal sports show . What else can they do to attract more visitors ? Stop all this fuss and enjoy the show .
They are all very experienced and great skiers . So I suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim .
Don't you know that ? Are you kidding me ?
Sorry . Well , they have the most advanced snowmaking machine .
It's possible . But the boss here said they were doing whatever they can .
Here we go .
Non-smoking , please .
Yes . My wife and I are interested in renting a house for the summer .
Furnished .
No , not all summer . Just for six weeks .
My holiday is only six weeks , but I think my brother and his family would take it for the other two weeks.Is the house in good condition ?
Yes , unlikely my flight will be 2 hours due to the fog . Would you please keep my reservation ?
Lincoln . That's L-I-N-C-O-L-N . Thank you .
That's good to hear . You've had an ideal recovery from your operation . We're going to send you home tomorrow .
Don't be in such a hurry . I'm confident that you'll be completely recovered in 4 to 6 weeks .
You'd better have a good rest for a week . Be sure to have regular meals . Stay away from alcohol.Give up smoking at least a little while .
Yes . I'm going to give you some.Take one tablet of this medicine three times a day before meals . For that one , two tablets . And remember to come to the out patient department for a consultation in two weeks , please .
You're welcome . We wish you a speedy recovery.Goodbye .
Please show me the menu again .
No , thanks . I don't like chocolate . I'd like strawberry pie .
Then I'll have vanilla ice cream .
Yes , hello , I would like to make a reservation please .
Tonight at seven .
In that case , eight o'clock is fine .
Four people .
Mark .
Yes , Sir .
All right , who should I send them to ?
Ok , home or office address ?
Should I enclose this commercial paper with these two letters ?
Thanks , doctor . Is there anything I can take for this headache ?
Okay .
I'd like to take some money from my Fund Account at the Securities Company . Is that possible here ?
Here it is . Could I make a balance enquiry , please ?
Fine , I'll take 10,000 RIB , please .
Thank you very much .
I'm afraid he is not in at the moment .
I think he will come back at 3 p . m . Do you want to call later ? Or would you like to leave a message for him ?
OK . I will do that .
You're welcome . Bye .
Yes sir , just a minute , please . I ’ ll check with the kitchen . Thank you for waiting . It takes another 10 to 15 minutes , I ’ m afraid .
I see .
Well sir , yes . How about this stew ? We can serve you at once .
No , tell him I'm tied up .
Tell him to call me tomorrow morning .
Thank you .
As you know , we are in a very special time . This is a very hard time for many countries ' economics , both developed and developing . I think the current economic situation could be described as synchronized slowdown of major economies .
Once the US economy is in trouble due to the terrorist attack , the impact could be quickly felt in the rest of the world .
We do face a lot of challenges because there is still much uncertainty about the world economy . It's very important for us to strike a proper balance between investment in fixed assets and household consumption .
There is a Matisse exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art . Larry and I will go .
No . Do we need tickets ?
Outside or inside ?
Hmm . It's very cold today.But I brought my jacket . Maybe it will be alright to wait .
MYOMA ? What's that ?
I see . Do you have any suggestions for other things we should do ?
How can we get up there ?
But Larry says the neighborhoods in the north are dangerous .
Yes , what about us having a tour ?
How about Milan ?
Why not travel by ourselves ?
Yes . I need some ice water delivered .
No , I have some , but not enough for the long weekend .
Thank you .
Same here . I've been looking forward to this .
No problem . That happens to all of us , it goes badly with the traffic .
Why not , thank you . A little tea would be nice .
OK . What do you want to know ?
OK .
Here you are .
Two years .
I'm a professor at a university .
I teach at Beijing Normal University , English composition and some conversational classes .
I have been coming here for the past few years .
It's actually a lot cheaper for me to wash my clothes here .
Why don't you wash clothes at home ?
Why don't you just get it fixed ?
So you plan on washing your clothes here from now on ?
Don't worry . Besides , it's a lot cheaper to wash clothes this way .
I am so happy to know that I could make some contribution to our company .
Thank you , I will be doing my best .
That's not a problem . Leave it with me , and find something that you like .
We have nothing on sale today . But we're having a big sale next weekend .
Everything you can see will be on sale .
The savings will be worth the short wait . See you next weekend .
Well . I can't find my key now . I think I have lost it .
I don't think so . I took it with me when I went out this morning .
Very well .
I need to make a transfer .
I want to transfer money from my savings account .
I want the money to be transferred into my checking account .
$ 200 will be fine .
I won ’ t be needing anything else .
Yes . What is the rent ?
Then what's the rent due date ?
He stepped out of the office for a little while .
In about twenty minutes .
Which book ? This one ?
This one ?
Here you are .
Yes .
An ordinary one will do.Would you put me under a hot dryer after that ? I'm in a hurry .
OK .
It ’ s true . You should be happy about that .
It seems not or somebody has recently received a large fax .
Do you know how to do it ? I am not so good at machine things . I will have somebody do it as soon as possible .
An understanding of the basic workings of a company and the services or goods it provides is essential . Do you have that ?
With that understanding , you can figure out what your company is looking for in terms of basic attitude . Right ?
What you wear is important . So keep in mind what is suitable for the company and type of work you will be doing . Need help ?
In addition to clothes we need to think about other basics , OK ?
Be prompt . Don't forget to be friendly and interested . Listen carefully and listen to what they are really asking you . You'll be a hit !
I did only simple things in the office , such as tidying up the office , serving tea , typing and filing , and so on .
I took such courses as Secretarial Principles , Office Administration , Business English , and Public Relations .
I'm off to Barcelona for a week .
Yes , here you go . I don't need a visa to go to Spain , do I ?
That's good advice .
Are there any seats available by the emergency exits ?
Ok . I'll take that one then .
I like to travel light so I just have this one .
Yes , please . That's a fantastic idea . Which gate do I need to go to ?
Well , we could probably get started with a strategy meeting tomorrow morning at 8
That ’ s fine with me . How much time are we going to have to work on this ?
Okay . Do you have a particular size in mind ?
Look at this one . It's our biggest pan .
Okay , we have the same thing in aluminum .
Try this one . Same aluminum pan , but with a heat-resistant bamboo handle .
That's a good choice . How do you want to pay for it ?
I'm so sorry . A lid comes with the pan . Here it is .
Yes . Is there anything you can give me to get rid of it , Doctor ?
OK . Thank you . Where should I buy them ?
Great . What floor is the pharmacy on ?
Thank you .
We'd like to visit the factory . Can you show me the way ?
How many shifts are there in your factory ?
What about your company's QC management ?
Where are the workers from ? From the villages nearby ?
It sounds nice . We can't wait to visiting the factory .
Open your mouth , please . Which one ?
I'm afraid we can ’ t save that one . It will have to come out .
I'll give you an injection , then you won't feel pain .
We have to find a shelter .
Let's go under the tree .
Then let's go to that store .
One second , sir , while I print out your receipt . Here you are .
May I ask , sir , if you enjoyed your stay ?
Thank you for your honesty . I assure you there will be no cockroaches next time .
I attended school today . Did you ?
I'm sorry to hear that . Would you like the assignments from English class ?
It's no trouble at all .
Thanks . See you at school tomorrow if you feel better .
Thank you , Mr . Owens , for taking time out of your busy schedule to interview me .
When can I contact you about your final decision ?
Thanks a lot ! I will look forward to the good news . Please call me at this number between nine and eleven in the morning .
The pleasure is mine . It ’ s nice talking with you . Good-bye , Mr . Owens .
Are you having a meeting ?
I understand .
Yes . Is there anything you can give me to get rid of it , doctor ?
Ok , thank you ! Where should I buy them ?
Great ! What floor is pharmacy on ?
Thank you !
well , I'm looking for some summer clothes .
Really ? What's that ?
I like this T-shirt . Would you like to help me look for any skirts that go with it ?
This one is good .
I'll take this one . How much are they ?
Here you are .
I got a sandwich , some chips , and a soda .
I got it from the cafeteria .
They messed up my order and gave me a bologna sandwich .
Considering it wasn't what I ordered , it was still pretty good .
Really ?
As I have some administrative experience from my last job , I may use my organizational and planning skills in the future .
By doing everything necessary and for further study .
How long I will stay with the company depends on whether the company and I are satisfied with each other .
I do believe this industry will be developed rapidly in 5 years time .
This is Mr.White speaking .
Yes .
Can you come to my office this afternoon at 3 o ’ clock ?
Thank you for calling.Goodbye .
I got stuck in a traffic jam .
It looks like you're very interested in the circus .
I have never seen those before , but since you're so excited it should be good .
Okay , I will go and get some popcorn first .
Help yourself .
Checking out , please .
Excuse me . What are these charges ?
Wait a minute . I made a phone call , but I never made a connection .
Isn't that a bit excessive ?
OK . Here is the money .
Yes , I'd like to look at some suits .
Size 41 . I want something in dark flannel .
It feels all right . But if it were a darker color , I'd like it better . This seems too light for winter . Do you think you could get me one ?
It looks good . But can I try it on ?
Thanks . It's comfortable . Well , how much is it , please ?
Ok . I'll take it . Here's the money .
Yeah , Why ?
You can bet on that .
Thanks , Mr . Liang .
Really ? I am too happy .
Thanks for your trust . Owing to my colleagues ' help , I've successfully completed my task .
Thank you very much . I will redouble my efforts in the future .
Thank you . Jack , it's always a pleasure doing business with you .
Great ! And , how are things in your neck of the woods ?
Oh.Jack , I have missed your sense of humor.Ha ha ha ! Nobody else sees things quite like you do.It ' s your gift .
Nope , it's a gift.Anyway , we need some more of those mid-range speakers you tricked me into buying last time .
Are you still gouging your customers the same price per unit ?
You silver-tongued devil . Can't you ever just answer a question with a simple yes or no ?
So far it looks like we will be leaving two hours late , but keep checking the departing flights status board just in case .
I think you should stay in the airport . Even though the delay is expected to be two hours , the flight departure could be announced any minute . Who knows ?
It seems there are some loose bolts on one of the wings . It happens all the time . No need to worry .
So , why don ’ t you ?
What do you mean ?
I can help you with that .
Just put your card into the machine .
Then you need to type in your PIN .
Just click on one of the choices they give you , and that ’ s it .
Yes please . Do you have any teas ?
What do you recommend ?
What ’ s this one ?
Ok , I ’ ll try that .
Yes . Look at these historical relics here , amazing !
For protection . Some relics will turn to dust if exposed to air .
No , there isn't . They are all vacuumed .
Yeah , they all come from a very ancient time .
The bronze cup was made 4,000 years ago . It's priceless !
Danny , priceless means so valuable that you can't put a price on it .
I have confidence in you . Believe in yourself .
We want one vegetarian supreme and one double pepperoni .
No , thanks .
Thanks .
Well , I'll be glad to help you out . We can deliver what you need to your office .
Fine , I'll bring both our office furniture and equipment catalogs on Thursday .
Sure , turn left at the next crossing .
Yes . You can't miss it .
I ’ m looking for a hotel near the convention center .
Not just yet . I have one or two questions . How much for a single ?
That ’ s a good deal . Since this is a working trip , I wonder if you have meeting rooms where I can get together with some clients .
That sounds great . Do you accept checks ?
Oh , is there ? Which room is it ?
You mean the room thirteen-thirteen ?
All right , ma'am . I'll check and tell them to be quiet .
Yes , I ’ Ve been there several times on business trips . But I have never really seen the terra-cotta warriors as it is outside the city .
I agree . As long as the food is not too bizarre once I saw some people eating insects . That is frightening .
Well , the airport is quite far from the downtown area , but it is still more convenient than taking the train .
A cheap day return ticket ?
That'll be twelve pounds .
Having a good diet is probably the most important thing .
You need plenty of fruits and vegetables , small amounts of protein , and whole grains .
You shouldn ’ t consume too much sugar or caffeine . Also , watch your intake of fatty food .
You need to stop smoking , and make sure that you get 30 minutes of exercise every day .
As long as you don ’ t overdo it , a glass of wine a day should be OK .
I am washing clothes . Are you hungry now ? Wait for a moment , I'll cook dinner for you . ( Steven bends his brows )
I can do all the housework . We don't need a maid .
We really don't need to .
Give me some time to think about it .
Certainly . How do you like your room ?
$ 40 per night .
Excuse me , can I change my order ? I am afraid I don't have so much time to enjoy my dinner .
That's all right .
Yes . I graduated this past June .
Guangzhou University .
I received a bachelor's degree in Economics .
My major courses were Microeconomics , Macroeconomics , International Trade , International Finance , World Economy , Psychology and Business English
Because I was quite interested in Economics then .
I can also speak a little Japanese .
Thank you very much .
OK , don ’ t worry about it . I will .
Okay , Bob , when will I see you ?
Okay , I'll see you later .
Well , sir . May I have your room number ?
Please fill out the form first .
Of course .
It says on the bottle here that you can have two refills .
Alright . I'm sorry , Miss . According to our file , this prescription has already been refilled twice .
Well , it looks like you have.You will need to see your doctor to get a new prescription .
I'm sorry , Miss . We can't do it . We must follow the prescription.And this prescription has run out .
Miss , I understand your problem.But it is against the law for us to sell certain medicines without a prescription.It ' s the law . I can't do anything about it.We never sell medicine unless we have a proper prescription . Never .
A prescription must be valid . It cannot be an expired prescription . I'm sorry , Miss . It's the law.You will have to find another doctor who will prescribe this for you .
Miss , I just can't help you on this . I'm a pharmacist , not a doctor . And there are other customers I need to help now . I know it is frustrating when this happens.But there is nothing I can do about it . I'm sorry .
Maybe that's true . I don't know.But I'm sure in Taiwan you have prescriptions too .
I ’ m trying to put the vase on the shelf .
No , thank you . I can manage it , I think .
Look at this one . It has a radio and cassette player and built in speakers .
Yes , but we shouldn't get any thing too big . Remember it has to fit in with our living room furniture .
Let's ask the salesmen for a demonstration .
You've been sneezing a lot lately . Are you sick or something ?
I never have seasonal allergies .
What are all the symptoms ?
That doesn't sound good .
Well , I have a severe allergic reaction to alcohol . It runs in the family .
I get it pretty bad . My whole face turns red , including my ears . My eyes become bloodshot , and I start to itch all over my body .
But that doesn't stop me from drinking . Ahahah .
All right . Wukesong stop is quite a few stops from here .
The train is coming . There are a lot of people waiting here . let's stand in a better position to get on the train
No , but it will be soon . Look , there're two empty seats over there . Let's get them .
I'm an apprentice with a local engineering firm . My training lasts for two years . Two days a week I study Engineering at a local college . If I pass all my exams , I hope the company will take me on as an engineer .
Dogs are nice , but they are really energetic , and you need to make sure they get enough exercise every day .
What about cats ? They are more independent .
How about a lizard ? Are lizards more along the lines of what you were thinking of getting ?
Yeah , they are pretty low-maintenance ; they eat almost anything .
I've been told that Chinese arts and crafts are famous for their excellent workmanship . We'd like to take some home . What would you recommend ?
No , not really.But I think it should be something distinctively Chinese . And easy to carry .
So , we'd like to see some embroidery .
I had some bread for breakfast .
Brunch ?
Actually , many Taiwanese wake up late on Sunday mornings , too . It may be a good idea for them to eat brunch instead of eating breakfast and lunch .
My name is Jeff .
I ’ m a podiatrist . What about you ?
I like to play piano , go bowling and chat with my friends.And you ?
Would you like to go out some time ?
Anywhere with you .
Well , it depends . You see , there are eight famous Chinese for instance , the Sichuan cuisine , and the Hunan cuisine .
That's right . If you like hot dishes , you could try some .
Then there's the Cantonese cuisine and the Kiangsu cuisine . Most southerners like them .
There's the Beijing roast duck .
You can find it in most restaurants , but the best place is certainly Quanjude Restaurant .
Not too near but not too far either . A taxi will take you there in 15 minutes , If the traffic is not too bad , I mean .
Let me write it down on this slip of paper for you . You can show it to the taxi-driver .
I ’ m well . And you ?
I don ’ t know if I told you or not , but I decided to start my own business .
I ’ Ve started an investment banking firm with some of my old colleagues from Goldman Sachs .
it started off a bit slow , but now , business is really booming !
our headoffice is here in Beijing , but we ’ re planning on opening up two more offices soon .
if all goes well , we ’ ll open one up in Hong Kong in April and another one in Singapore in October .
we ’ re negotiating the final details of the leasing contracts tomorrow .
thanks !
Pretty well . What about you ?
It's a bit disappointing that they are all out for a movie .
Not bad . I heard you are going to graduate this coming summer , right ?
Did you go to a real estate agent ?
That's true . By the way , what kind of apartment are you looking for ?
Sure . I'll try my best to find a satisfying one for you .
My goodness ! It ’ s the afternoon ? Doesn ’ t the time fly ! Do come in and sit down .
What ’ s the time ? My watch has stopped .
When do you have lunch ?
What do you normally eat ?
Oh , it ’ s time to have lunch now .
Merry Christmas , Jina .
Come have a look , I received many beautiful e-cards . They are from my friends , all over the world . Christmas wishes for all my friends .
Sorry , I don't have it . But I do have her Email . You want me to sent it to you ?
No worries . I just for her card . And you can get her from Email . I would really like to talk to her again . I kind of miss her a little this days .
My pleasure .
Use them from the outside in .
Right . We do the same thing at home . Don't you remember ?
Let's look at our menus .
Well , we order appetizers first and then entrees .
Why are you trying to rush me off the phone ?
Why ? I still wanted to talk to you .
Like what ?
I'm not . I just want to know .
That's harsh .
Fine .
Sorry , I won't . I'll be working against the clock to finish my presentation .
Have I really got to do those exams again , Dad ?
And must I go back to school ?
But Dad , I should be working full-time at my age . I ’ m nearly 17 .
What else I ’ Ve got to do ? Join the army ?
How do you do ?
I come from the city of Tangshan in Hebes Province .
Really ? It's nice to meet you . How long have you been with this company ?
Oh , Thank you very much !
Can't complain . And you ?
Let me see . I can come out and see you first thing Wednesday .
O . K . We offer a few different kinds .
That would be our Saver's Plus account .
You have to maintain a balance of $ 10,000 in the account or the rate drops to 3 % .
Just fill out these forms , and I ’ ll be with you in one second .
How about an outlet ?
Outlets give good deals .
You're welcome .
Actually there is a sample over there . But if you still have a problem , let me know .
Yes , we shall . What size do you like ?
Which do you prefer , color or black and white ?
OK .
They will be ready at noon tomorrow . Each negative develops one print , right ?
No problem . Do you need another film ?
It is totally $ 20 including the deposit for films .
You mean the network connection ?
I have the same question . I can ’ t send out mails . We ’ d better call the IT department and ask them to check it immediately .
Alright . Have you been to this hospital before ?
I understand . It's good you came to the emergency room .
I'm sorry , sir . You will need to wait at least a short time.We are very busy tonight . There was a big car accident on Highway 106 .
It is . But unless you are critically injured , you still need to wait.You aren't bleeding , are you ?
Oh , that's terrible . Is it your right arm or your left arm ?
Can you fill out this form then ?
That's very inconvenient for you then.You ' ll probably have a cast on your left arm .
Yes , it is . But even in emergency rooms there is some paperwork to be done.Have you ever been in an emergency room before ?
Be brave , sir . It won't be long . I will fill out the form for you . What is your name ?
Alright Steve . Your social security number ?
Do you have medical insurance ?
Do you have your insurance card with you ?
Well , you can call it in later . You can phone us .
First I need to get your address . Try to move your arm as little as possible .
Yes , it is . Thanks . I ’ m just surfing on the internet .
This cafe offers a wireless internet connection . That means I can get on the net for free while I ’ m here . Of course , I have to buy a cup of coffee !
No . you can only do it when the cafe offers a wireless connection . There are only about 10 or 12 places that offer it in this city .
I ’ Ve got all the usual ones for word processing and then I have a few for creating and editing photographs .
It ’ s wonderful , isn ’ t it ? Would you like to see some photos that I took recently ?
We'd better stay in the hotel , because the tour will begin tomorrow .
What an excellent idea !
OK .
Yes , some exercise is necessary for us .
Sure ! That would be great ! Are you good at writing or would you rather do the computer work ?
Great ! We are going to be working in teams of three . Are you OK working with others ?
We will begin next Monday . Would you be available then ?
Well , if you could send me your basic background information before next Monday , it would be useful .
Well then , thanks for your help . Have a great day !
Thanks , Monica . Without support from you and other colleagues , I would not have made it .
Well , just saying that you wanted to get promoted is not enough , you need to write down your desirable position and an available plan for achieving that adjective . Don ’ t be afraid of taking challenging . They might be opportunities and failing is not fatal . You learn more from that actually . Sometimes , you need to fail to be successful .
I think it is a smart idea . Our boss always likes it when employees take initiatives .
Yes , sir . Where to ?
Are you in a hurry ?
I'm afraid not , sir . Generally we can , but you know how it is in the rush hour now .
All right . I'll do my best .
The reading on the kilometer is 12 $ .
Do you need a receipt ?
Susan , I'm sorry . Did you look up those files I requested ?
I couldn't find the files you request , even though I checked all the cross-references . I don't think it's there .
Well , let me check again under a different heading .
Maybe that's why I couldn't find it . All the documents on Nova are filed under ' V ' .
I'll try Chinese wine .
OK . Give me one , please .
Thank you .
Yes . Are you ?
What ’ s your polling place ?
Oh , yeah ?
I don ’ t know .
The location of my polling place never came in the mail .
Let me go do that .
Sure . I will clean the glasses for you .
Walk straight and turn left .
You do realize that you ran a red light , don't you ?
You didn't see the red light ?
Didn't you learn that red means stop ?
Then tell me why you sped up on the yellow light .
I'm giving you a ticket for this .
Maybe you'll think about this before you decide to run another light .
Good afternoon , could you connect this call with Mr Brown , please
This is Li Ping of ABC computer company limited . I'm calling on our Mr Wilson the general manager of our company .
I'm afraid Mr Wilson would like to speak to Mr Brown right now.He ' s got an urgent matter to discuss with Mr Brown without delay .
Thank you for your assistance , Mr Bush .
Oh , that's right . And the general manager asked me to report the company's sales for last year at the meeting .
OK , thank you very much .
Of course . What do you want me to do , Mom ?
Alright , what's in them ? They are so heavy !
Well , hurry up and open the door please . I told you these things are heavy .
Oh , yes , it's in my pocket . But how can I get the key while I'm holding all these bags ?
Yes , Mr . Ford . The dentist will be ready to see you in a minute . Have a seat .
I am not sleepy .
There is no way that I can fall asleep right now .
It won't work . I'm nowhere close to being tired .
What if I stay up and do something , until I get tired ?
I'm going to get to sleep eventually .
Good night .
What did you find ?
Go and try it on .
I love that shirt on you .
They don't really fit you right .
That blouse is absolutely wonderful on you though .
That would be a good idea .
Thank you very much . I ’ Ve tried to keep it short and clear . If there ’ s any questions please feel free to ask me .
Yes , of course . Well as you can see from the resume I ’ m 27 and grew up in Brooklyn , New York , although our family moved to London when I was quite young , at around sixteen .
Yes precisely . Although I was born in the US , I would definitely call London home . But as you see I ’ Ve actually spent a lot of my life moving from country to country . My Father was in the oil business before he retired so we also spent a number of years in Saudi Arabia too .
Absolutely ! We were never still for too long . But now I ’ m really looking to settle down .
We ran a call center training service and language program to ensure that our customer service representatives are well trained .
We directly attribute an increase in our customer service feedback of 50 % to the increase in language skills and training that our employees have received .
Thank you , but I cannot take all the credit . Our employees have all worked very hard to increase their productivity level .
I'd been feeling pretty well until just a few days ago .
I feel run down , tired . I've been having headaches almost every day . And I'm not getting as much sleep as usually do .
Well , I haven't been eating well , I guess . I usually only have enough time to grab a sandwich and a cup of coffee for lunch .
Sometimes I'm too tired to eat anything at all .
I don't like to take any medicine at all without talking it over with a doctor first .
No , thank you .
That would be great .
I need it delivered tomorrow . Will that be possible ?
I need it delivered at 12 o'clock .
That's not a problem ?
That's great ! Thank you very much .
Yes , I'm looking for a house .
Oh , to rent .
About 300 a month .
How big is it ?
Well , actually I prefer something a bit bigger if that's possible .
How much is it ?
What's it like ?
It sounds interesting . Can I go and see it ?
Yes , Sir .
All right , who should I send them to ?
Ok , home or office address ?
Should I enclose this commercial paper with these two letters ?
Oh , it ’ s the latest novel by Ray Blue . It ’ s a sic-fi thriller .
He does . He ’ s good at this genre too . It ’ s a captivating read .
Yes , I would . I need to buy a textbook for my course and , as you know , I love browsing through the latest paperbacks .
I want to look at nelson Mandela ’ s autobiography .
How long have you had this pain ?
Did you do anything that might have aggravated your tooth ?
What kind of toothbrush do you use ?
Does it bother you when you eat something really cold ?
Good evening.My wife and I would like a room , please.Is there any room available ? We don't have a reservation .
Good.We ' re tired after driving all day , and we're looking forward to relaxing in a comfortable room .
How much is it for one night ? We only need it for tonight.We ' re going to continue our trip in the morning .
No , it's just the two of us .
Credit card.We don't like to carry much cash with us on our trips .
Thank you very much .
What do you want to do ?
That will make him so happy .
One that won't grow up too big .
Do you know which one he would like ?
I bet you had to drag him away .
I wonder what he'll name it .
OK . Is it in the box ? May I see it ?
Is there anything else ?
Is that all ?
It depends on the weight of these things . Generally speaking , we will charge you ten yuan for one kilogram .
Please go over there to weigh them .
didn't you hear ? He was disqualified .
if he didn't have any drug problems , he would have won .
he was taking steroids to make him stronger and faster .
they are . The reason why they didn't disqualify him until after the race is because the results from the text only came back afterwards .
I don't think it's right , but I can understand why they might . Imagine how much pressure there would be to win for your country !
I agree . Hopefully with the new regulations , fewer athletes will try to cheat with drugs .
What ’ s stopping you ?
I don ’ t understand .
I can help you figure it out .
Slide your card into the machine .
You need to type your PIN in .
Click on whichever option you want , and you ’ re done .
Yep . There's still so much to do !
Did you reconfirm the plane reservations for all the Taiwanese guests ?
Cool ! I can't believe he agreed to go all the way to Dallas with us !
We have a great variety of Chinese antiques and porcelain . Do you like them ?
You are right . How about paintings and embroidered handkerchiefs ?
Of course . These paintings have many designs , such as animals , flowers , landscape , aquatics and so on .
All right . Chinese embroidery is one traditional art with elaborate design and high quality .
This is a series of animals , called Chinese zodiac .
OK , I will wrap them for you .
No , it's too loud in here .
Yes ?
Certainly . Go along Queen's Road ...
Yes , and turn right at the Hilton Hotel .
Then go up Garden Road , past the Cathedral .
Yes . Then cross the road at the next traffic lights . The Peak Tram is straight ahead . You can't miss it .
Yes . Why ?
I'm starving . Let's go grab a bite .
How about Karlis ?
True . ok Let's go to Grumose ?
I guess it is a little pricy .
That will be Ok . Come on , I can't wait to chow down .
Is that why you stiffed the waiter ?
Good morning . I'd like a business suit made with this material .
The kind that never goes out of fashion , I guess .
I'm sure you're right . I just dread the idea of making a new suit every year .
Good . I think I'll choose this single breasted one . When can I get it ?
Thank you .
Don't take it too hard . There are some tips you should know in job-hunting of 2010 .
Firstly , you must always show your best to the interviewer . And secondly , try to avoid spamming through e-mails , because this will make the reader go crazy . The last but not the least , there is no substitute for pounding the pavement in such a digital age .
Good luck to us .
Oh , I remember , there is a job fair in the personnel market .
Really ? I have been there several times .
Yes . The personnel market is a place specially for job-hunters and employers .
Yes , there are many famous corporations .
Every Saturday and Sunday
No , it's free .
OK , let's go .
Here you are . We have three different colors , white , blue and pink .
$ 12 .
It is cheap .
$ 10 . That's the best I can do .
Yes , yes . It seems that everything is settled .
We have discussed it and decided that at the moment we would like the salaries to be paid into the employees's accounts , whether they are currently with this bank or not .
Of course , if we are happy with the service after the initial period we will recommend all employees either transfer their accounts to this bank , or open new accounts with you .
We should plan to move out of here before July . I'm tired of living in apartments .
We need to find a good realtor .
What do you mean ?
But doesn't a realtor help with the contract ? I thought they take care of all the legal troubles .
I still think we should have a realtor.We ' re new in this country . We don't know all the laws of buying a house.And also , the realtor will inspect the house.He can tell us if the house has
So how can we find a house if we don't have a realtor ?
And doesn't the person selling the house have a realtor ?
Why ?
Hmm . It all sounds very complicated .
I want to look in the papers today . Maybe we can see something we like .
Sorry to hear that .
Fine , we'll be expecting you then .
I'd like to taste Mexican food .
Oh , I've never seen a better Mexican restaurant .
I know , but these are the figures that we came up with .
You ’ re welcome . Can I ask you what brings you to China ?
Oh , very nice . How long will you be in Beijing ?
Oh , I see . Well , I ’ ll give you my phone number and if you need a guide , please call me .
Sure , but I have to finish this report first .
Yes , in some sense . I should say I like mountain climbing , you know , because I'm not so professional . How about you
How did you spend the night there ?
I had a similar experience , but that was on the top of Tasha Mountain in my country .
Yes . It is one of the Five Mountains .
I'd love to .
I have a spasm of nausea and dizziness .
No , this is the first time on a plane . Maybe you are right .. Please get me some pills .

Not really . Quite boring right now , actually . Mostly infomercials and public service announcements .
I know , I know.But my favorite show is on in a couple of minutes . It's the series finals , and I wouldn't miss it for the world !
Well , it's about how an immigrant girl achieve her dream in America . It's a sitcom but really quite smart and really funny . I think you'd like it .
I believe some shows are quite informative and interesting . Take this show for example , it examines American xenophobia and how it might conflict with the American dream , with hilarious results .
Yeah.Oh , here it comes ! why don't we watch it together ? they are going to have a court debate in this episode . It should be good .
Would you turn off the tap ?
Then will you put all the towels under the bathroom door .
I will have our housekeeper come right away .

If you enter this company , what section would you like to work in ?
Then , what starting salary do you expect ?
Let me see . Here it is .
I ’ m afraid I can ’ t because I ’ m a stranger here .
Not at all . You can ask the policeman over there .

I'd like the egg drop soup .
Yes .
Just nice water , thanks .
Wow , fantastic . I like the font and color for his name . It is creative yet personal .
I agree . Business cards are great tools for promoting personal business . It won ’ t take much time to design an amazing card , but it can make a big difference among the crowd . And you ’ ll always notice it from your collection . For they have outspoken colors , own design and the sizes are not always according the mainstream business card . I wish to have one like this . But for sure our company has its own corporate design which all employees have to follow .
Yes . Where do you want to go ?
This is the right bus .
Certainly.Four more stop after this . I'll call out the stops .

That's 626-555-1739 . Thank you so much for choosing our hotel , sir !
yes , doesn't everyone ?
it's hard to say . While dogs are more affectionate , cats are much easier to take care of .
when I was little , we had a few domestic dogs at home .
definitely . rich or poor , dogs always love their masters .
i had one a few months ago , but she ended up running away .
she left through a window that was open one night and never returned .
i was pretty sad . i still hope that she'll return some day !
I think I will . It's difficult to feel longly when you have a pet around .
i do , too .
we just moved in yesterday , actually .
it's great ! Unfortunately , we're going to spend a fortune doing everything up .
it's about 200 years old . It has a lot of history !
it's just off of the ring road .
it's bigger than our last one . I've got flowers in the front , and fruits , vegetables and a fish pond in the back .
oh , yes . Our windows let plenty of natural light in . They've also got wonderful views of the park behind our house .
right now , there are three bedrooms , two barrooms , a kitchen , a sitting room , a dining room , and a living room . We're hoping to add on a green room and a guest bedroom . In fact , when the guest room i
Your achievement is obvious to all .
Yes , this is also the competitive edge of our company .
Yeah me too . Oh ! Can we stop at the shop really fast ? I lost my makeup bag at the airport and I want to pick up a few things .
No ! Five minutes I promise !
Are you crazy ? You have no idea what you are talking about ! Just for my eyes I have to get eye-liner , an eyelash curler , eye shadow , an eyebrow pencil and mascara . Then I need to get foundation , liq
What about you ? You spend as much or more money on your razors , after shave , cologne and gel ! Not to mention how much you spend on clothes and ...
Yes , but I think I'll have orange juice first .
Well , I think I'll try the pancakes . How about you ?
What are you waiting for ? Rip ‘ em open !
It's nice , but how much did you end up paying ?
Hmm ... not so hot . They sell them here for about that .
I'm not sure . I was thinking of making a vegetable .
Do you know what kind of vegetable you want to eat ?
How would you like the corn ?
Do you want it boiled , grilled , or microwaved ?
That's how you want it ?
Okay , I'll grill some corn then .
I'm sorry . Something is wrong with my taxi .
Let me stop my car for check . Oh , my god . I got a flat tyre .
Sorry . You'd better get off for taking another taxi .
I am going to buy some food to cook for supper .

I ’ Ve been having trouble breathing lately .
No , I haven ’ t had a cold . I just have a heavy feeling in my chest when I try to breathe .
No , I don ’ t have any allergies that I know of .
It happens a lot when I work out .
Thank you for your help , doctor .

I spoke to a girl named Claire on the phone ; it's about losing my card and everything .
So , I can get my new card today ?
7 days ! What am I supposed to do for money until then ?
Dad ! I don't have time ! I'll be late for school !
Dad , I never eat breakfast .
Uh ! Dad !
Alright . You win . Please pass the brain food .

Really ? I didn't expect that .
I should have booked the tickets in advance .
I am so glad they called you . It feels like something is really wrong with my stomach !
It ’ s mostly on my right side . Right here !
I started feeling kind of sick last night after dinner , but this morning the pain got really bad !

I think I know it . I wonder whether the agreement has the guarantee of law or not .

When I have some time , I like to exercise .
I joined Samsung Health Club a couple of months ago .
I usually spend 30 minutes on the bicycle for the Carpio , and then I lift weight for about 45 minutes .
I want to go four times a week , but I'm too lazy . Last week , I only went to workout once .
Hi , Alex !
I just got back from London .
It was OK . There was a lot of turbulence , though .
It was 10 hours .
Yes , in paris , France .
Yes . I bought two boxed of chocolate ? one for me and one for you !
It was nothing .
Sure . Our special wine today is a 1989 Chardonnay .
It's $ 4.25 cents by the glass . The whole bottle is $ 22.5 .

Good . I'll take care of it .
Are you sure ? Do you have somebody in mind ?
OK . Just keep in mind it has to be somebody who can get along with Elvin .
I needed to ask you a question .
How many hours of the behind-the-wheel course do I need to take ?
I want to get my license .
How many days do I need to finish the course ?
Is that all ?
That sounds easy enough .
Wait a moment , mom .
Mom , just ten more minutes . The show is going to be over soon .
Yes , I do . How can I help you ?
Of course not . What exactly would you like to know ?
It's 1200 . Room service is available 24 hours a day .
Yes , the control unit is on the wall next to the bathroom . Is 24 ° C all right ?
You should call the Housekeeping Department on 2300 . They will replace any stock for you immediately .
That's no problem . Just dial 9 to get an outside line , and then dial the number as usual .
No problem , sir . If there's anything else you need , you can find me at the desk by the elevator , or you can call housekeeping if I'm not there .
Goodbye , sir .
No problem . Would you like some artificial carnations ?
How much did you want to spend ?
Our most elegant flower is Golden Lily .
Do you want to add some baby's breath for that ? They are equally popular now .
Yes , but there is a five dollars delivery charge .
Good Morning , I have a bad cough , and I want to see an internist .
No , I don ’ t . I ' m a tourist .
Here you are .
I ’ d like to try traditional Chinese medicine . I heard it really works quite well if you know what you're doing .
I'm just poring over some brochures about various car models .
Yeah , it looks that way . My wife has been bugging me about it . I thought we could probably survive without one , but with a baby on the way , maybe it is time to get a car .
That's right . For quite a few years , I rode a bicycle to work . Then I got a motorbike .
Oh ... I don't let her ride with me . It's just too dangerous . She takes the bus to work , but it is sometimes difficult to get a seat and it's crowded and hot .
Yes , but it's also a pretty big financial responsibility .
I'm having a hard time deciding which model is best for us .
Yes , I'd like a Jeep , but my wife says we have to get a comfortable sedan for long drives home to see her relatives .
I'd like to send a fax to Shenzhen .
Each of both .
Here you are .
Well , how long will it take to arrive in Shenzhen ?
Great . How much ?
Thank you . I will deal with it .
Here you are .
Business .
Oh , yes . May I sit on the grass ?
Yes , I can see it . But what's on it ?
Well , there's a bench under the tree . We can sit there .
Why not ?
Do you have a reservation ?
Wait a second , PLS . Yes , Mr . Lee , we have a room reserved for you . How long do you plan to stay ?
Would you sign the register , PLS ?
Certainly , every room in this hotel has a private bath .
Your room has twin beds , Mr.Lee . It also has a view . I am sure you will like it . This is your key . It's on the eighth floor room 801 . The elevator's over there .
The restaurant is on the second floor . We also have a cafeteria on the top floor . If you would like something to drink , you can either call room service or come down here . The bar is right behind the lobby .
You are welcome !
Where do you live ?
The 264 will take you there .
I know for a fact that it goes to the station .
If you go to Altadena Drive , you can catch it there .
Yup , it does .
It was my pleasure .
I have a problem .
Someone else is making charges on my debit card .
I have it right here .
The last four charges .
How long will that take ?
I really appreciate your help .
Yeah , sure . Let's go .
All right . Now what ?
Which direction should I take ?
Tell me how far to go .
Okay , but let me know ahead of time .
That was great . Thanks for taking me driving .
How's this one ?
What about this one ?
Hi . Is there a special rate for a group reservation ?
I need five single rooms in October . How much of a discount can I get ?
Front view , please .
October 25th around 2:00 in the afternoon .
Ok . I ’ ll send a check .
Sure . My name is Anderson . My address is 109 Ferguson East , Holton . And my phone number is 309 789 1267 .
It's about 3 kilometers .
Why not walk further to the tree over there ?
Oh , what's up ?
Well , the best thing to do is to go down to the front desk and ask for a duplicate key .
What happened to you ? You look like you got hit by a tornado !
You mean at the mall ? Was there a sale ?
Cool !
We don't have a swimming pool , sir , but we do have swim stations in the gym .
It's just a deep bathtub with a current of water that you swim against .
As a guest , sir , you pay nothing .
If you want to swim , you can visit the gym any day between 7 a . m . and 10 p . m .
I'm sure you'll enjoy your workout , sir . Everyone seems to like the swim stations .
Hi , Christine . How ’ s it going ?
Sure , just a second . All right , what time ?
Yes , I want to book a room .
Well , could you let me see the room ?
It's fine . What beautiful scenery outside the window ! I think this one will do .
Centrum ? We have bottles of thirty and one hundred tablets . Which kind do you want ?
And what kind of toothbrushes would you like ?
Sure . This brand is supposed to be very good , but they're expensive . Those are new products . They come in several colors and sizes . There is also hard , soft , and medium .
This one is 10 % off . That one has no reduction , but you can get a free tube of toothpaste with six toothbrushes .
That's right .
And here is your aspirin . What else did you say you want ?
Anything else ?
Sure . Here you are . This one is excellent . Just mix one drop of it with milk .
What kind of keys ?
What a shame ! I didn't see them .
Sure . It's my pleasure . I'd like to help you look for the missing keys .
It's not a big deal.Hey , I found them .
You're welcome .
Good coming . I would like to open a new account . I want to deposit 500 dollars .
Could you tell me how many kinds there are in your bank ?
Oh , I think I'd like to take the monthly savings account then .
OK . Here you are .
Thank you . Goodbye .
Good morning !
I just feel a little tired . You know , it took me 16 hours to get here .
That's very kind of you , but I can do without a rest . I have long wanted to have a talk with you about the possibility of business between us .
Thank you very much .
I believe I will .
Let me see . It's 9
I think so . I set it by the radio this morning .
Well , it's the 10th and on the Tuesday .
I'd like to leave this bag with you .
Well ... there is a necklace in it .
Well , don't bother . I'll take it with me . Will that be all right ?
Sure . thank you .
Let's go take a look at it . Do you have your ID with you ?
Okay , I see the problem . You forgot your code , didn't you ?
The machine gives you three attempts to enter the correct code and after that it assumes that you are not the real owner and confiscates it .
Yes , I can get it for you but I need to go back inside the bank .
Her name is Rose.Why ?
Oh , shut up.She ' s already got married .
Of course not . We have 50 channels in all .
OK . I will send a maid to your room right now .
I'm getting sleepy .
Time difference also makes me feel weak .
It's four o'clock in the morning in Chicago now , but it's time to go to bed in Shanghai .
I'd like to reserve a table for two , my wife and I .
I'm not sure . Perhaps around 8 PM .
Juliet , Juliet Berman .
Non-smoking will be fine , please . But it is more important that you get a table by the window . It's our anniversary , and I'd like to be very special .
Thank you , goodbye .
Good morning . There is no reason to miss so beautiful a morning . Is that a new bird ?
It looks so cute . Is it a parrot ?

He can speak English , too .
Lulu . Lulu . Say hello . hello . Oh , she is so smart . Good bird .
an mp4 player ? why don't you buy a new cell phone ? You can find an mp4 player inside any of the latest cell phones .
look at my cell phone . I can listen to music , watch movies , take pictures , play games , surf the web and download documents . It's just like a PAD .
that's Ok . you know , digital devices are becoming smaller and easier to carry , and they won't cost you too much .
that's right . what's the flash memory of your old mp3 ?
then any cell phone can meet your need because they generally have memories of over 512MB .
A cheeseburger and an order of french fries would be great .
I feel like having a Coke .
It was pretty bumpy , also a bit long , all together about 5 hours .
Actually I feel quite rested . I was able to sleep on the plane .
That will be very nice . You're too kind .
Sounds great . Thank you for your hospitality .
That's all right . I can manage .
Thanks for the warning .
I'm so happy you remember , please come in and enjoy the party . Everyone's here , I'm sure you have a good time .

You like my living room set , don't you ?
I found mine at IKEA .
Everything I got from IKEA cost me a couple thousand .
The furniture isn't built cheap .
You will feel comfortable paying the money .
We need lots of things . I ’ ll make a list . We need a bag of sugar , a loaf of bread and a crate of beer .

OK , thanks for the order .
Nothing special .
It's wet and rains a lot.But right now it's the golden season to take a tour there . It is fine there almost everyday .
It's not so hot as it is here .
Hmm . That must be the DVD player that another one of my friends donated . He owns one of the largest electronics stores in Taipei !
Don't worry ! There are a lot more prizes ! I know , because the prizes are all from companies that I work with !
When will I know your decision ?
It ’ s quite convenient .
OK . Thank you very much .
It can ’ t be time to get up yet .
What ’ s the time ?
My watch says ten past .
