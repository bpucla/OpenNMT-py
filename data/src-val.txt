Good afternoon . This is Michelle Li speaking , calling on behalf of IBA . Is Mr Meng available at all ?
Oh , hello ! Sorry about that . I'm just calling to say that we've received your new Corporate Credit Card from HQ .
Yes , our application procedures have speeded up since we started using the new fast-track system .
Or we can send it to you . But if you would like to use it at the ATM , you'll need to wait for your PIN number .
As long as you bring your ID , etc , we can serve you over the counter . But you won't be able to use the ATM until your new PIN number arrives .

Please fill out this form , also please write the value of the items in this space .

You dare to doubt me ?
Excuse me , sir , I'm afraid you can't park your car here .
I'm afraid not , sir .
But I saw a red car always parking here before .
Maybe . But the car of this space has a broken rearview mirror on the left .
Could you wait for a minute , sir ? I'd like to have a check .
Sorry , sir , my mistake . This is your parking space .
What can I do for you today ?
Were you looking at a particular refrigerator ?
This particular refrigerator is a very good choice .
Not only is it affordable , but it comes with all the appliances .
It has an ice maker , water dispenser , and plenty of room on the inside .
Go right ahead .
Oh , well . It was fun to be the winner . But ... it's too big . I must be an extra small in the States .

What do you think is the most important thing when looking for a job ?

Why is that ?
Good morning , Helen .
So , what's the status of our advertising campaign ?

Mr . Johnson ’ s office . Cindy speaking .
No , I ’ m sorry , Mr . Kurt . He ’ s stepped out for a bit . Would you like me to have him call you ?
Hi , Mark .
All right .
This is the lease . You should read the lease very carefully before you sign it because it describes your legal rights and responsibilities as a tenant . The lease also describes our rights and responsibilities as landlords .
Yes . If you do not damage the apartment , you will get your security deposit back when you move out .
Sure . A check will be fine .
Yes .

With pleasure . We arrange two kinds of tourist programs for Suzhou , a six-day tour by train and a five-day flying journey .

Eight hundred and fifty yuan .
I can't believe you wear jeans to the office ! Are you trying to lose your job ?
Wow ! Nobody told me about that . Won't the relaxed dress code damage the company image ?
I guess it lets people express their individual tastes . But won't some people abuse it ?
It seems that a relaxed atmosphere could hinder productivity .

Hello , Mr . Wang . I am glad to meet you here at the fair .
Sure . Thank you . It seems your business is prosperous . There are many customers here .
Well , what do you think of choosing a commission representative or agent abroad to promote your sales ?
We are willing to be your agent in Thailand for hand-held tools . What do you think ?
Then , what's your usual commission rate for your agents ?
4 % is too low , I think . You see , we have a lot of work to do in sales promotion , such as advertising on radio or TV , printing booklets , leaflets , catalogues and so on . It all costs money , 4 % is not enough .
You mean to saya
We may deduct the commission from the invoice value directly or remit it to you after payment .
Think it over . We hope to keep a good business relationship with you .
I'm glad these batteries are on sale .
But that's what the ad said .
Oh . You're right . I misread the ad .
Well , you can't blame them . It's a confusing ad .
Well , as long as I'm here .

Can I do anything else to help with the itching ?
I appreciate you helping me find a solution to the itching .
Excuse me . Something is wrong with my bank card . Can you help me ?
Just a mistake with my name . It should be issued as Steven , but the card is under the name ' Steven ' .
OK , no problem . To err is human .
We are doing Secret Santa at the office again this year .
I got Jacob . Any ideas what to get him ?
Is everything to your satisfaction ?
Oh , sorry to hear that . This is quite unusual . I will look into the matter .
I'm sorry , sir . Do you wish to try something else ? That would be on the house , of course .
How about a delicious dessert then , with our compliment ?
Excuse me , are you Jane ?
Oh , are you in Class Four ?

Hey , I'm feeling much better already .
Thanks . By the way , my name is Mary .

You're looking rather pale , why ?
You'd get plenty of sleep for you work so hard .
You shan't drink more wine in the evening .
And you'd take some exercise every day .
Hello Mrs Parker , how have you been ?
Very well . Let's see , according to his vaccination record , Ricky has received his Polio , Tetanus and Hepatitis B shots . He is 14 months old , so he is due for Hepatitis A , Chickenpox and Measles shots .
Well , I can only give him these for now , and after a couple of weeks I can administer the rest .

I have a TEFL certificate .
I have three years of teaching ESL and four years of teaching per-school children .
I got my TEFL certificate three years ago .
Well , I ’ Ve heard many good things about it . I also like teaching young children .
Yes , just a little .
I sure can .
Why is the car before us stopping ?
Look . Two cars are standing right in the middle of the road and the drivers are shouting rude words to each other . That's why that car stops .
This is today ’ s schedule . At 8 thirty AM , conference with the department managers . At 9 o ’ clock , live for the workshop where you ’ ll award prizes to the staff for preventatives .

This is Lincoln Bank , Consumer Credit Department . How can I help you ?
We offer a Personal Automobile Consumer Loan . The application process is pretty straight forward . I trust you have enough funds to cover the 20 % down payment ?
The next step is for us to recommend a dealer to you , who are already contracted to us , so ...
That will certainly cut down the processing time . We can move on to the next step . Do you have the purchase price ?
What we need you to do next is to come into the branch with a correctly filled in application form , ID card , proof of residency , proof of income , the agreement from the agent and of course the 20 % down payment .
Hi , my name is Tom .
Nice to meet you too.Melinda .
Really ? This is a nice office , but it's quite small .
It looks like you guys work hard .
Hmm ... Tell me more details about our jobs .
What do you think of our price ?
Yes . We regret we cannot maintain our original price . Since the prices of the raw materials have been raised , we have to adjust the price of our products accordingly .
I don't think so . You must compare our price with that of other export houses . I'm sure our offer is in line with the prevailing market price level .
I ’ m afraid that there is no room for any reduction in price .
We've already cut down our price to cost level .
Yes , this is the best we can do .
So , Jimmy , how does it feel to have your own money ?
Even though you are only twelve , it ’ s not too early to start saving a little money .
You know you would spend it . And also , money in the bank earns interest .
The bank will give you a PIN , and you can withdraw money from any ATM .
Not quite . You have to maintain a minimum balance of twenty dollars . And sometimes the bank has service charges . But you don ’ t have to worry about that yet . Let ’ s go make your first depot
Is this where I can catch a bus to the theater ?
Which bus do I have to change ?
Here we are , Joan . This is the Palace museum , also known as the Forbidden city .
Excuse me . I'm afraid I got lost . Where am I on this map ?
Oh ! Can I go from here to the Zhongshan Park ?
Tony , could you tell me if there are any special rules about the job ?
Is there anything else ? How about my salary ?
Wow , thank you for telling me these . Do you mind telling me something else , like attendance record , holiday , and how to ask for leave ?
Kate , you never believe what's happened .
Masha and Hero are getting divorced .
Well , I don't really know , but I heard that they are having a separation for 2 months , and filed for divorce .
Masha , it seems quiet and makable , no quarrelling about who get the house and stock and then contesting the divorce with other details worked out .
Overseas operator .
Your name , please .
What's the number , please .
Hello . Excuse me .
Do you remember me ? I just had lunch here a half hour ago .
I think I lost my wallet here .
Really ? You didn't find a wallet ?
Yes , I would . It's not here . And it's not on the floor.Has anyone sat at this table since we left ?
Hmm . I don't know how it could have happened .
No . My friend did .
No , I'm not sure . But I usually take out my wallet when I sit down.It ' s uncomfortable to sit on it . So I usually put it next to me on the table .
I don't think it's at home . I think I had it when I left the house.But what should I do ?
Should I call the police ?
Hmm . I'll go home and check . Maybe you're right . Maybe it's at home .
Good morning , young lady . You can call me Ma . Do you see anything you like ?
That quilt was passed down to me from my ma in Holland .
Well , this home is too big for me now , so I'm moving to an apartment that is much smaller . Therefore , I need to part with a few things .
Have you got change for a thousand ?
May I come in , Mr Sun ?
Can I try later then ?
Is it all right for me to come in now , Mr Sun ?
Do you mind if I sit down ?
I want to leave the department . Do you think I could put info a transfer ?
Do you mind if I speak frankly ?
Well . You see , I don ’ t like the office . I don ’ t like the staff . And I ’ m afraid of you . And I don ’ t want to go one . So may I put info a transfer ?
Where is that ?
Are you in a hurry ?
We'll make it except a jam . You know it's rush hour .
I'll do my best .
Do you have small bills ?
Recently I have been getting headache and my eyes don't seems to see focus properly .
Two years ago . At that time I had no problems.Now I can ’ t even make out something ten meters away .
All right .
Well , this one is worse .
Is there a car park near the supermarket ?
Oh , come on , Ultraman !
It says that there will be a blackout from 5 p . m . to 7 p . m . in our neighborhood today .
Don't you know you will look like a monster in the blackout ?
That's not the point . Come on , can you imagine that there will be no electricity on such a hot day ?
OK , since you are the smart one , can you come up with a better plan ? So that we won't be baked like cookies here .
Barbie ? You know , I might be seven , but I'm not a girl .
Yes , ma'am , how could I help you ?
Yes , we do .
From 200 to 800 .
Can I help you , Miss ?
How soon do you want it ?
No problem .
Certainly .
I hate to do this to you , Alice , but I ’ m going to have to ask you to put in some more overtime .
Well , I would have preferred to do it today , but if you ’ Ve already made plans , we can do it tomorrow .

Hello ! Is your company advertising for administrative assistant on the newspapers ?

Of course . I will deliver my resume to you in minutes ' time . I hope you will consider my application and I shall appreciate a reply at your earliest convenience .
Just as the saying goes , every potter praises his own pot . You should pay special attention to selling yourself properly in the interview .
You'd better prepare what you are going to say in advance , in order to have a good performance in the interview .
Only when you are aware of what the interviewer will be interested in , can you make a targeted preparation .
Selling yourself should go straight to the point , and the statement should be clear and brief .
You should particularly state your strong points which are closely related to the position you are applying for .
Time permitted , you could add certain examples to your description .
Hello ?
What are you doing in Australia ?
Oh , right . What time is it there ?
Yes - four o'clock in the morning .
John hasn't turned up and Stefan is ill . Do we have anyone on stand-by ?

Some people are wildly shooting on the next street . We must leave here as soon as possible !
Hello . May I speak to Jerry , please ?
I see . Can you give me some idea how long he'll be back ?
That's nice . My name is Steven , my phone number is 6789777 . Okay , I'll be waiting for his call . Thank you and bye !
Excuse me , Miss .
I've just heard an announcement that my flight has been delayed .
Flight CA216 to Chengdu .
Could you please tell me why ?
How long will the delay be ? Do you have any further information about it ?
We have to wait . Well , is it possible for the rain to stop before noon ?
Yes , I will . Thanks a lot . Bye !
What are we going to do ? I can't get the car out of this ditch . I'm stuck !
I know . This is terrible . What can we do ? This snow doesn't stop falling !
I wanted to show you the cabin . We only had another half-hour to go .
I don't know .
What do you mean ?
I have plenty of gas .
So what can we do ?
Alright . That's a good idea .
Days ?
Oh , my God ! It's good we have food .
Hey , buddy , can ’ t you see there ’ s a line ?
What ? You haven ’ t taken the bus before ?
Well , you have to wait in line like everyone else . Besides , you should let old people on first .
It ’ s all right . Where are you going ?
Oh , well you don ’ t want this bus , anyway . It goes to Georgetown .
It ’ s all right , though . Just get off at the next stop and catch the 79A .
Can I help you ?
What kind of drink would you like with that ?
Would you like a super size meal ? Only 2 RIB more , you'll get large coke and fries instead of medium . And today we are offering free toys all the meal boxes .
That's not a problem , Miss . Will that be it ?
That will be 25RMB , please
Do you have any night tours ?
Is that a guided tour ?
I am sure we will make it up as soon as possible .
We hope this matter will not affect our good relations in our future dealings .
I would like to purchase some meat .
First off , I'm going to need a pound of ground beef .
That's perfect .
I'm also going to need three pounds of chicken breasts .
What's the total price for the chicken ?
I think you know already that I want to discuss the represent - ton for your alarm clocks .
Is that so ? Anyhow I want to go over the details with you in person , so you can give my suggestion thorough consideration . Our firm specializes in this line of business . We have six sales representatives , who are on the road all the time , covering the whole of the European market .
Yes , we specialize in handling clocks and watches of all sorts . We have well established channels of distribution and we canvass the retailers direct , without any middlemen .
In some cases , such as the wristwatches , which always have a steady market , we keep a stock in London and act as distributors as well as agents . Generally , however , we pass on the orders of our clients to the manufacturers for supply . We are paid for our service , of course .
Yes , our commission is very reasonable . We usually get a 10 % commission of the amount on every deal .
The European market is not familiar with your products . You have competitors from Japan and other continental countries . At the beginning of our campaign , there is sales resistance to overcome , we must send out salesmen to do a lot of traveling and spend a considerable amount of money on advertising in news - papers and TV programs . A 10 % commission will not leave us much .
We will always do our utmost to enlarge the business , as our remuneration increases with the turnover , but we will not guar - ante anything , at least not to begin with .
Do you mean to say you refuse us the agency ?
Oh , that's just too bad . I intended to make great efforts in selling your products .
Ah , Mrs . Miller , but in this case am I covered ?
All right , but I'll be back again for the Autumn Fair . And then I hope we can see eye to eye about our commission and the terms of the agency .
Excuse me , I ’ m sorry to trouble you . My name is Susan Ransom , and I have placed several orders with you company .
Well , I wonder if you could track an order I placed with you last month . It hasn ’ t arrived yet .
Have you worked out the offers . Mr . Thou ?
Are the prices on the list firm offers ?
I wonder whether there are any changes in your prices .
How long does your offer remain valid ? I need some time to get my supervisors on board with this plan .
Hello sir , may I help you ?
I see . Well , you have come to the right place . We have over one hundred models of more than twenty leading mobile phone manufacturers .
We have this new ETC smart phone.It comes with the Android OS so you can download applications . It also has a built-in camera , mp3 player and touch screen . It works on the 3G network so you have fast access to the internet wherever you are .
Of course ! You can access the internet from any hotspot as well as from home .
We have been over this a hundred times ! We are not getting a pet !
Who is going to look after a dog or a cat ?
What if we want to take a vacation ? Who will we leave it with ? Plus , our apartment is too small for that breed of dog .
We ’ re planning on having children soon , I don ’ t think those animals are a good idea with a baby in the house .
I ’ ll tell you what , I can get you some hamsters and we ’ ll take it from there .
Good evening , Mr . Lee and thank you for choosing our airline . We have just discovered that this flight is overbooked . Would you like to volunteer to give up your seat ?
From time to time we have a situation in which there are more passengers than there are seats on the aircraft . That ’ s overbooked .
Actually it ’ s a common practice to overbook , as passengers often don ’ t take their flight as scheduled . Most of the time there is no problem but today , more passengers arrived than we have seats ,
Well , first we ask for volunteers . If someone like yourself volunteers , they receive a free round trip ticket to be used within one year . If no one volunteers we just have to select someone .
I want to rent this apartment .
How much are you asking ?
I can ’ t afford that .
I was thinking $ 800 a month .
How much more ?
I can live with that .

Welcome to the McDonald's . What will it be for you , madam ?
Is there anything else ?
Is this to go or to eat here ?
That comes to four dollars and ten cents .
What's the name of this street ?
Do you know of any banks near here ?
Hey there , you look a little lost . Are you new here ?
You can always spot the newbies . I can give you a few pointers if you want . Were you trying to use this machine here ?
It ’ s ok , I know how it is . This machine here will work out your upper body , mainly your triceps and biceps . Are you looking to develop strength or muscle tone and definition ?
In that case you want to work with less weight . You can start off by working ten to fifteen reps in four sets . Five kilo weights should be enough . Now it ’ s very important that you stretch before pumping iron or you might pull a muscle .
Excuse me.Could you tell me how to return to the Hilton Hotel ? I am afraid I lost my way .

That's very clear . I think I can find my way now . Thank you .
How does the political system work in your country ?
Each mp belongs to a political party , right ?
What ’ s a cabinet ?
Can any mp make a law ?
I suppose a proposed a law needs the support of the big political parties .

Hi . I need more amenities , please .
Well , to be more specific , the free stuff , like soap , lotion , and shampoo .
Oh , no ! I've got all I need for my stay here .
I need souvenirs !
Yes , yes . Souvenirs .
That's not the same thing . If you buy hotel souvenirs , they have no sentimental value .
Hello , may I help you ?
Oh , how nice.They ' re bright rooms and the house is very quiet .
Well , gentleman.Each room is $ 40 a week if you think that's OK .
When do you want to move in ?
Are you ready to order ? May I suggest a veal ?
The chicken is also nice .
Our special tonight is lobster .
Perhaps you'd enjoy the lamb .
Am I ever hungry ? When will supper be ready ?
All right .
Yeah . Oh , it's delicious !
Definitely . It's a wonderful meal . Thank you , Honey .

Not at all , sir . Here you are .
Just a moment , sir . I'll calculate that for you . It comes to 305 dollars and 52 cents at today's exchange rate .
How would you like to make the payment ?
Thank you , sir ... Here is your change . Could you check it , please ? Thank you for choosing our hotel . I hope you enjoyed your stay .
Hi , Sam . I want to buy a pet . Do you have any ideas ?
why ? anything special there ?
Oh , really ? are there any snakes ?
that's terrific . I can't wait to check it out .
why not ? it's so cool .
pardon ?
well , I didn't realize that .
oh , I should have thought of my brother's baby girl . Maybe I'll just have a dog instead of an exotic pet .
I ’ m a new student . My name ’ s Robert .
Are you French ?
No , I ’ m not .
I ’ m Italian . Are you a teacher ?
What ’ s your job ?
I can ’ t believe Obama is our President .
You voted for him , right ?
I did , too .
Really ?
We do need some change in this country .
You ’ re absolutely right .
Do you have a reservation , sir ?
I ’ m sorry the restaurant is full now . You have to wait for about half an hour . Would you like to have a drink at the lounge until there ’ s a table available .
Yes , of course . May I have your name , sir ?
we ’ ll try to arrange it , but I can ’ t guarantee sir .
Do you have coffee shops in China , too ?
You like to go to these places , don ’ t you ?
Do you often go there alone ?
Hi there ! I am looking for a new car . I have this old Ford Pinto that I would like to trade in .
Perfect ! I like this one .
Sounds like a good car ! How many miles to the gallon ?
That is really convenient . Especially now that fuel prices are so high ! What ’ s under the hood ?
Now for the most difficult question . What is the price tag for this lovely vehicle ?
I wonder if you could help me , I'm looking for a room .
What sort of price are you asking ?
Would it be convenient to see the room ?
Could you give me an expense report ? I would like to attach the invoices for my phone bill this season .
That is very kind of you . I ’ m just running out of glue .
IBA , Jane speaking . How can I help you ?
Sorry , I'm not quite sure if I understand . In what way , Sir ? Has your card been stolen ?
Oh , I see , Sir . Well , it does take 5 working days to issue and post the card .
Sorry , Sir , but it's 5 working days . This does not include weekends , so your card should be with you later this week .
It's no trouble at all , Sir . Is there anything else I can help you with today ?
What can I do for you , sir ?
Yes , sir . What would you like ?
OK , and when shall I bring it here ?
What shall we do when we find a shortage in the shipment ?
Shall we leave it to the brokers ?
Do they charge for that ?
Is it the same in America ?
It's part of their service , isn't it ?
Is it enough to claim with an on board bill of lading ?
I see . By the way , how do we prove the ownership of our goods ?
I see . Thank you .
I'll be on business for a couple of days , could you take care of your sister ?
Passport , please , madam .
Thank you . Please fill out the Baggage Declaration Form .
I ’ m hungry , let ’ s go grab a bite to eat .
Will you take long ?
Come on ! We have been here for almost an hour ! I thought you said you were only going to get a few things ! How long does it take you to pick out a lipstick and some nail polish !
Whoa whoa whoa ! Are you nuts ? How much is all this going to cost ? I ’ m looking at the price at each one of these little things and it ’ s outrageous ! This is basically a crayon !
Can I borrow five bucks ?
Come on ! I'll pay you back on Tuesday .
I promise if you lend me five dollars today , I will repay you in full next week .
Fine ! I can't believe you don't trust me .
May I help you , sir ?
Any particular colour ?
How about this one ?
Well , they come in white , pale yellow , aqua , red and green . Will a white one do ?
I ’ m so surprised to meet you in this remote village . Long time no see .
You look terrific and in good shape .
How do you keep fit ?
Yoga ? It sounds interesting .
Anything else ?
Are you interested in swimming ?
Are you going home now ?
What are you going to do ? Are you going to work late ?
An apartment ? Why ?
Where are you living now ?
How are you going to find an apartment ?
Apartments in the city are expensive .
no , no , you helped me with my computer last week . I want to repay the favor .
oh , that was just a quick bite to eat---that doesn't count !
I am waiting for a fax but just now I found there ’ s something wrong with the fax machine .
Yes , very urgent . And there is no other fax machine around . And the office of our boss is closed , so I can not use his machine either . And his secretary is out . Do you have any suggestion ?
Hey , Jim . It's time to wake up and get out of bed .
You'd better get up , or you'll be late .
Yes , it did . It went off thirty minutes ago . You slept right through it . You're like a dead person while you sleep .
Rise and shine ! Sleepyhead !
The early bird gets the worm .
What shall we do tonight ?
That's a good idea . We haven't seen a film for ages . What would you like to see ?
I ’ Ve been told you might have a vacant room .
How much are you asking ?
Could I see the room , please ?
Sit down , please . What's wrong with you ?
How long have you been like that ?
Let me have a look at your throat first . Please open your mouth and say " ah " .
And show me your tongue ... Thank you . That'll do . You have slight tonsillitis , and your throat is inflamed . How is your appetite ?
Now , let me take your temperature . Please put this thermometer under your armpit and let me feel your pulse ?
Do I have a temperature , doctor ?
Yikes ! What was that noise ?
Did you have to blow right next to the phone ?
Of course I heard that . I thought a plane had crashed into your house .
I will blow my nose sometime for you , and you'll see .
I thought you had an elephant in your house .
What did you say ? I think I've gone deaf .
Can I have the check please ?
Is this amount correct ?
Thank you , the service was good
Nowadays fewer and fewer people go to the movie theaters to see films . So I am afraid that the film studios are really getting hard time to survive .
But it is true that cinemas are losing the attraction they used to have in the past .
Okay , well I ’ m sure you have a number of questions to ask me regarding the position .
Well feel free to ask me anything , and I ’ ll try to fill in the details .
Yes , of course . That ’ s quite an important point , isn ’ t it ? As a junior sub editor we offer a starting salary of 150,000 HK dollars per annum . This doesn ’ t include a generous housing allowance also .
Well , apart from full health insurance we do offer a company staff bonus scheme linked to readership numbers . But we could go through all the details of that at a later date .
We need to take the accounts system offline to carry out the upgrade . But don't worry , it won't cause too much inconvenience . We're going to do it over the weekend .
We'll be taking everything offline in about two hours ' time . It'll be down for a minimum of twelve hours . If everything goes according to plan , it should be up again by 6 pm on Saturday .
Welcome to IBA . Can I help you ?
Thanks . I'm sorry to say that you need to get this stamped . There is no stamp on this slip and it is essential before I can process it for you .
Yes , that's right . Down here , at the bottom right hand corner to show that you agree to pay the printed amount .
That's the warehouse where the large items of office equipment are stored .
Excuse me . I have just missed the connection plane due to the heavy fog in London . Can I change my ticket now ?
Here you are .

Good morning . I need to speak with the property manager , please .
While it was raining last night , water started leaking in from the ceiling .
It was in the living room .
We are on the bottom floor .
Yes , someone will be here to let you in .
How much is your last salary ?
How much do you want us to pay you ?
I hope you can help . I've got a bit of a problem with your ATM .
Well , it's eaten my card ! It won't give it back !
Yes . I was only entering my PIN . I'm terrible at remembering it , I'm so forgetful , you see .
Maybe three times . As I said , I always forget it .
Oh , I see . So if I call my branch they can sort everything out for me ?
Is this the counter to pick up parcels ?
I want to pick up my parcels .
OK . Here you are .
Thank you .
Hi Brittany . What are you doing with all of your clothes on your bed ?
Oh , A . Mom didn't tell you ?
This Bs ' school you're going to is going to make your life easy .
Uniforms , sis , no more worrying about appearances !
What would you like for your main dish ?
How would you like it ?
Anything else , sir ?
Mr . Smith , do you like the hotel we booked ?
I've come to make sure that your stay in Beijing is a pleasant one .
David , we have been doing business for three years , haven't we ?
So , I wish to apply for the sole agency of your product in our local market . If you give us the agency , that will be more substantial for our cooperation .
As we are a well-established company , we are very familiar with the customers ' needs . Besides , we can make full use of our good connections with the wholesalers and retailers here and develop a good market for your products if appointed as your agent .
To be on the safe side , and for garment of all materials , sizes , and styles , I think the amount will be 50,000 pieces a year .
Excuse me .
I bought this circulator here yesterday but it doesn't work .
Where can I find the produce ?
What sales do they have today ?
Hello , this is Steven from Blue Sky Co . May I speak to Mr . James ?
Excuse my troubling you . You purchased our products last year and now I am following up to find out about their workings . Are they still in good condition now ?
That's it ! All of them have first-class quality and performance . Besides , we adopt advanced technology . Now we have developed new products . They are much better than what you have bought .
That's great ! Thanks for your support . If any , please remember to call us . I am afraid I have to say goodbye now ! Bye , Mr . James !

Do you have any questions we didn't cover in the interview ?
Thank you , I am looking forward to hearing from you . Bye-bye .

Yes . Sometimes I can notice a constriction in the chest and shortness of breath after a fit of sneezing . And I often suffer from a running nose with a profuse watery discharge .
It has been seasonal during these past three years .
Yes , things like seafood and penicillin-type drugs .
What useful treatment can you offer ?
Miss , would you like to try this free sample of our new suntan cream ?
This is a new product of company this year . It's oil-free .
It gives your skin a very natural healthy look .
So how can I make it ?
But I ’ Ve gotta have the budge before anything else .
Did you have a part-time job when you were still in school ?
Yeah , I worked about twenty hours a week in a pizza restaurant .
It was always very busy there .
I stood behind the register and took pizza orders .
Hi . May I help you ?
1.15 U . S . dollars to the euro .
Sure . How much would you like to change ?
Very good . May I see your passport ?
How would you like your bills ?
Why are you reading the classifieds ? What do you need ?
Are you having any luck ?
Do you mind if I go with you ?
I learned to negotiate from my mother . I thought I was pretty good at bargaining , but I had a problem the other day at Kimble's Department Store .
Do you do a lot of your shopping online ?
No . I ’ m a little worried about security . You never know who ’ s trying to find out your codes and passwords . Aren ’ t you worry about that ?
I ’ m surprised to hear you say that . I thought you loved anything technological .
So , how about coming to the department store with me ? I want to see if there are any new summer clothes on sale yet .
Sure . While you ’ re in the computer store . I will visit the book store opposite . I like to browse through their books and see if they have anything interesting .
Please help yourself at your dishes . I hope you ’ ll enjoy what you ’ Ve got .
Would you like to try my special recipe ?
Mr . Dick . Does the recommendation of the university play an important role ?
But I find that most of the recommendation letters written by universities are the same . So I doubt its authority .
Could you tell me whether or not I send out my resume with it ?
Taylor , can you tell me how to apply for a job on the Internet ?
Do I have to send an E-mail ?
But I still don't know which unit is in need of staff .
Can any unit see my information ?
Which websites offer this service ?
Don ’ t throw your weight around . I can ’ t bear you any more .

You want to argue your ticket today ?
Tell me your argument .
Are you sure you weren't speeding ?
What speed were you going ?
I'm just going to let you go , since the arresting officer isn't here .
Don't worry about it .
Annie , do you like shopping online ?
Last week , I tried to buy a new cellphone online , but I didn't know how to pay for it .
Are there many things online ?
That's amazing . Oh , an on line virtual supermarket ?
Ah , Bob . Just the person I wanted to see .
You gotta help me out this time , buddy .
Hey ! What happened ? ! My song was only half way through and it skipped to the next song .

Are you ready to order ?
Let me tell you about the specials of the day , which are chicken in a wine sauce with capers , and grilled garlic shrimp .
The chef would be happy to accommodate your special requests .
You could choose the roasted vegetable and garlic pizza or the goat cheese and candied walnut salad .
That is a good selection , and I can bring your salads now or serve them with your entree .
I can't open this email attachment our Paris office has sent me .

How would your friends or colleagues describe you ?
What personality do you admire ?
How do you get along with others ?
Hi , I need to make an appointment to see the doctor .
I have a rash that I need a doctor to look at .
No , it just itches a lot .
I need an appointment on Tuesday .
I would like to see Dr . Jones .
Wow ! What's the hold up ?
Really ? Then , I guess I won ’ t have a hard time finding a room or getting a cab ?
Hello , how can I help you today ?
Please fill out this slip stating how much you wish to withdraw .
On your account there is no limit to over the counter withdrawals , it won't cause a problem . Here's your money , 10,000 RIB . Please count it before you leave .

Do you eat a lot of vegetables ?
What do you like to drink ?
Whatever would you like to drink ?
How often do you exercise ?
It's a good diet and a regular exercise .
I am sorry , but I cannot stay for the rest of class today .
I don ’ t feel so good .
I feel as if I am going to be sick to my stomach .
I have some medicine at home that I could take .
Thank you , but my friend is in the library , and he can give me a ride home .
Your boyfriend is so considerate to you . When do you plan to marry ?
We're considering of ordering 200 computers , but I'm wondering about the price you'll possibly offer .
Your price is higher than I expected . Could you give us a little discount ?
But the price is always negotiable and you should consider our quantity of order .
Could you make it $ 4500 ?
Can we meet each other half way ?
Let's close the deal at $ 4800 , OK ?
I'm now on the Songshan airport getting ready for departure . I realized that I might have left my watch .
My name is Terry . I stayed last night in your hotel in room 132 .
It's a brand-new Seiko wrist watch .
What are your thoughts on the apartment ?
There aren ’ t any problems with the apartment ?
What problems ?
We will have the carpet cleaned before you move in .
Yes , but other than that , are there any more problems ?
I ’ m happy that you find this apartment so appealing .
That China-gown of Tang-Dynasty style is so beautiful . Would you show it to me , please ?
Could I try it on ?
It feels a little tight around the waist . Do you have a bigger one ?
OK . How much does it cost ?
Mrs . Wang , would you give us an idea of the price you regard as workable ?
Just to comply , we're ready to reduce the price by 5 percent . I hope this concession of ours will get the ball rolling .
The ball is in your court , Mrs.Wang . What price would you suggest ?
That won't do . You see , our profit margin is very narrow . It simply can't stand such a big cut .
Well , I'm not authorized to agree to such a big reduction . Would you mind waiting a day or two , until I get a reply from the home office ?
Good morning .
I ’ m sorry She isn ’ t in at the momment.She will come back at half past nineCan I take a message for her ?
OK.Goodbye .
Hi , Jane . How are you doing this morning ?
Late night ?
We've been waiting here for nearly ten minutes now , and there still isn't a bus in sight .
Have you got the time , Tom ?
But you bought it only last month .
How long will it take us to get there ?
It's not far away , then . Let's walk , it's beginning to rain .
Hi , Mr . Smith . I'm Doctor Hawkins . Why are you here today ?
Yes , well , you haven't had one for 5 years . You should have one every year .
Well , the best way to avoid serious illnesses is to find out about them early . So try to come at least once a year for your own good .
Let me see here . Your eyes and ears look fine . Take a deep breath , please . Do you smoke , Mr . Smith ?
Smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer and heart disease , you know . You really should quit .
Well , we have classes and some medications that might help . I'll give you more information before you leave .
Good afternoon . Mr . Tylor's office ?
I'm sorry , but could you please transfer this call to Mr . Tylor's office ?
Thank you .
You are so kind , you helped me a lot .
Good afternoon , Lexington Software . Angelina Dawson , how can I help ?
Ah , hello Quinn . Oh dear , you are calling to tell me there is a problem , aren't you ?
Hmm ... well , it was my first attempt ! Is it a very big mistake , or can we just alter it ?
What do you recommend we do ?
Oh ! ! ! I have a horrible toothache .
I hate dentists .
It always hurts . I hate going .
O . K . , O . K . , I ’ ll go .
Hi , I would like to purchase a one way ticket to Brussels , please .
How long does it take to get there ?
Yeah , I think that is the best option . Do you serve food on the train ? Twelve hours is such a long time !
Great ! I ’ ll take it .
I understand . Thank you very much !
I would like to take a trip to the beach this weekend .
The forecast says that it will be warm on the weekend .
It sounds like it will be .
That would ruin things , I want to go so badly .
That is true . The weather is constantly changing .
That would be great , then we could plan things sooner .
Some companies use to ban dating among employees , but now they have realized it is something in avertable . People spend so much time at work . It is not surprising for one to have a crash on the other .
Beneficial ? I don ’ t think so . If two employees get married , they will leave at the same time for a honeymoon , or later one of them will stay at home taking care of babies . If they break up , the company will probably have to relocate one of them to make the workplace more comfortable . By any means , the company must spare extra efforts to solve problems brought by an office dating .
Do you eat a lot of healthy food ?
You have the point . I think cancer is caused by more worry than by the things we consume . Some good things you should try are cranberry juice , wild rice and yoghurt .
Cranberry juice is very good for destroying harmful bacteria in your guts because it's very acidic . Wild rice is high in fibre so it's good for your guts and it's high in protein and minerals-I think it's also tastier than normal rice . Yoghurt's good because it's also rich in protein , vitamins and is also acidic . People have been making yoghurt for thousands of years and if you have it every day , your guts will be much more settled .
I've been so tired recently . I've been trying , but I don't think I'm up to this job .
Oh , yes , indeed . I've run out of steam . To be honest , I want to be in a different environment .
Yes , I don't want to be stuck in a rut . I want to move on .
Yes . I want to get a better job .
I quit just because of the dissatisfying salary and the trouble in getting along with my colleagues .
I'm afraid not . I've promised my girlfriend . We'll travel southwards to find a job that offers higher pay .
Thank you so much for your advice .
The train is leaving . Hurry up ! Which car are we in ?
Here we are , Car 11 . Let's get in .
Let's put our suitcases on the rack .
So , how should we get to the theatre ?
I hate the bus system in London ! The bus drivers are rude , the buses are never on time , and there are few people around who can help you .
It wasn't just once . Every single time I take the bus , something bad happens to me or to someone else on the bus .
Train fares are twice as expensive as the bus fare , too .
We're already late , so I think we had better take a taxi .
Fine . Have a look at the timetable to find out when the next one arrives .
Thanks , that was nice of you .
Let's go over this plan again .
And that is mostly flat , right ?
And from Winnipeg we go around the lakes through Toronto , right ?
It doesn't sound like that much when we go over the plan but that's a long , long ride .
Good morning , sir . What can I do for you ?
I'm awfully sorry , sir . I do apologize . Room 908 is at the end of the corridor . It's possible that the noise is heard early in the morning when all is quiet .
No problem , sir . We'll manage it , but we don't have any spare room today . Could you wait till tomorrow ? The American People-to-people Education Delegation will be leaving tomorrow morning . There'll be some rooms for you to choose from .
It's time for bed .
It's quite late , and you have an early day tomorrow .
Why don't you try counting sheep ?
That's beside the point , you still need to go to bed .
If I let you do that , then you're just going to be up all night .
No , you're going to sleep now , so good night .
I see myself as being honest , diligent , persevering and creative . And I have a strong sense of responsibility .
I think I can work well under pressure , if necessary .
I will just be sincere and friendly to others , and I believe they will treat me the same way .
Thank you . I simply believe the goodness of human nature .
Karen ? I need to go over a few things with you .
I was thinking about this afternoon , after the sales meeting .
I believe we ' Ve met before . My name's David .
Oh , I remember now.Very nice to meet you again .
I made my little brother cry .
I need some mascara . Do you have good thickening mascara ?
Alright . And I want to consider your eye shadow too . Do you have a color chart can look at ?
Oh , sure I will need to clean off my own eye shadow first .
Is this the baggage claim area for flight KB256 ?
But I am a transfer passenger . I have a connecting flight to Miami .
Yes.It ' s quite troublesome .
Billy , you don ’ t look too well . Maybe you should take the day off school .
You ’ Ve got a fever and playing football isn ’ t a good idea for a boy with a fever . What ’ s that on your arm ?
It ’ s rash . I ’ d better take you to see the doctor . How did you get that bruise on your leg ?
Does it hurt ?
Here . Put this wet towel on your face to keep your temperature down . I ’ ll take you to the doctor ’ s after breakfast .
This is your schedule .
Are there any vacancies still available ?
I am looking for a job that is more advanced than that , such as sales manager or regional manager .
My name is Mary , and I will be your waitress tonight .
Before your main course , would you like to order an appetizer ?
There is a special appetizer menu right here in the center of the table .
You know , that is one of my favorites !
You could choose another appetizer for half price to share .
I am waiting for a fax but just now I found there's something wrong with the fax machine .
Yes , very urgent . And there is no other fax machine around . And the office of our boss is closed , so I can not use his machine either . And his secretary is out . Do you have any suggestion ?
I would like to speak to you , if you don ’ t mind .
I would like to talk to you about this year ’ s election .
I am a volunteer for this year ’ s campaign .
I know history is about to be made , and I would like to be a part of it .
Are you planning on voting ?
Go to your polling place early on Election Day .
We hope that there will be no repetition of this kind of trouble in the future .
We look forward to your settlement at an early date .
Hello , Steven . How do you get along with your job ?
Practice makes perfect . By the way , what do you learn from your job ?
Yeah , you are a good learner . I must commend you for your good performance .
I appreciate your effort very much . The coffee break is over ; it's about time we set to work .
Where on earth are we ?
What did I do wrong ? Did I take a wrong turn ?
Well , now we should turn back a few kilometres .
Hello . Front desk .
Hi , Bob . What can I do for you ?
Could you please tell me why ?
So you need a quiet side room on the lower floor .
Okay . Let me check for a room on the first floor .
I ’ Ve only two rooms on the first floor . How about room 108 ?
Sure . I ’ ll send the bellman to help you .
How long will it take for our order to be delivered ?
Fine , we will handle domestic shipping , but what about customs ? Will we have to pay tariff on our imports ? I hope we don't run into any problems with the border control .
Now you're my boss , Mr . Henry .
No , nothing in particular .
What are you doing here today ?
Is the arresting officer in the courtroom today ?
What's your case ?
Do you believe that the officer lied ?
Your license plate was caught on camera ?
Since there is no picture of your license plate on record , I'm going to let you go .
Hey Joe , what are you doing in this department store ?
Why not ? When I go shoe shopping , I have so many options for sneakers that I spend awhile looking at all of the choices .
What do you mean ? This is a big store , isn't it ?
So how do you usually go about buying shoes , then ?
Well , you're in the right store . If they don't have it , no one will .
what shall we do after the volleyball match ?
that's a good idea . I was thinking of buying some gifts for my family .
I haven't decided yet , but I think the Olympic Mascots are a must .
is that the red one ? That is my favorite , too . Do you know how much they are ?
oh , I see . If I buy more than a set , can I get any discount ?
any other ideas ?
Mom ! I hate eating vegetables !
Thanks mom ! Can I have dessert now ? I love chocolate cake !
But I don ’ t like them ! It ’ s not fair !
Ok ... actually , I don ’ t mind eating peas and carrots , buy I hate broccoli and cauliflower .
It was very kind of you to give me a tour of the place . It gave me a good idea of your product range .
Very impressive , indeed , especially the speed of your NW Model .

Certainly . Who should I say is calling ?
And what is it regarding please ?
Right , let me run through your options . You can go ahead and cash your undue Large-Amount Deposit Certificate if you really want to , but I'd recommend a Personal Durable Commodities Loan .

Not at all , Mr Zu . As the certificate is due in 2 months , you can get the loan on mortgage of that certificate .
Exactly right . If you'd like to go ahead , I can process that for you now , Mr Zu .

The consignments of chemical instruments have just reached us . We have to lodge a claim against you for inferior quality I am afraid .
We bought 1,000 sets of chemical instruments from you , but there are 40 not up to the standard .
Here is the survey report from a well-known public surveyor in London . You may inspect the defective instruments personally
Forty faulty instruments means that 4 % are not up to the standard . You should compensate us for 4 % of the total account on the contract , as well as for the inspection fee .
Hi Bill , I saw your grandma yesterday .
I was running around the track at my college and there she was walking around the same track .

I don't think you've met my sister , Mary .
Come and meet her now .
Excuse me , would you tell me how to return to Hilton Hotel . I'm afraid I lost my way .
Let me see . Yes , I have the address and hotel telephone number here .
The bathroom looks lovely . Did you redecorate it yourself or did you get someone in to do it for you ?
So , let ’ s see . You have put new tiles on the floor and replaced a few tiles on the walls . You ’ Ve also added a small cupboard for toiletries . The bath , shower , and washbasin are the same as before , aren ’ t they ?
How long did it take you to do the tiling .
I think you ’ Ve done a very good job . As least as good as a professional would do . Perhaps I can convince you to redo my bathroom ?
I'd like to see that pen , please .
No , the other one in the brown case .
May I try it ?
It's very smooth . I'll take it .
I ’ Ve come to hear about your offer for bristles .
Why , your price has soared . It ’ s almost 25 % higher than last year ’ s . It would be impossible for us to push any sales at such a price .
I ’ m afraid I can ’ t agree with you there . I must point out your price is higher than some of the quotations we ’ Ve received from other sources .
I agree that yours are of better quality . But there ’ s competition from synthetic products , too . You can ’ t very well ignore that . Prices for synthetic bristles haven ’ t changed much over the years .

I see . Do you want to work full-time or part-time ?
I'll make note of that . Now , what are your salary expectations ?
My lease ends next month , so I have to find a new place .
Do you know any places ?
Thank you . I think I should also have a look at the Internet to see if anyone's got a sublet .
I can only afford about 1,000 yuan a month .
It doesn't matter , but it needs to be close to the subway or on a convenient bus route .
I want a bedroom with full bath , and it'll be better if the bedroom is on the sunny side .
Why ? Will those be students who are leaving ?

What do you mean ? What are you talking about ?
Can you give me a hand with some things in the kitchen ? I don ’ t think I can finish everything in time .

What would you like to eat tonight ?
Do you think Kentucky fried chicken is good ?

Just one thing before you go , could you please prepare your documents in accordance with the L / C within the validity period ?
Hello , Mr . Thomas . Could you spare a minute ?
I need to talk to you about that new driver you ’ Ve hired . I think I am going to have some problems working with him .
I can't stand the stupid guy any longer . It ' s unbelievable !
He does everything so mindlessly that he is going to drive me crazy .
I have told him how to do it several times , but he's never listened to me .
Oh , I always have difficulty in getting along with the staff .
I think that's a bad idea . I'd hate anyone here to think of me as a friend . How would they ever respect me as they can do whatever they want ?
hey , you look great ! how's everything ?
really ? tell me about it . I haven't gone to the club for a long time . I am too busy with work .
you're right . Too much or too little won't do any good .
sounds reasonable .
and fruits !
I've heard that . Does your trainer tell you anything about keeping fit ?
I think if you follow your trainer's advice , you'll be on the right track .
Staying out all night , you frightened me to death .
You should at least give me a call .
Did anyone call ?
What did he want ?
What kind of job do you intend to do ?
What are your plans if you were hired ?
You stepped on my foot !
what do you think about the public service advertisement for quiting smoking ?
why not ?
it's a pun . They use the fish hook to make you think about how you can get hooked on smoking .
I think they're trying to scare the young people so that they don't ever start smoking .
perhaps you're right , , though . Maybe the advertisement would be more effective with adults anyhow .
that's a good point . I think I was so delighted to see that a billboard was being used to promote health that I didn't think about how children might understand the ad .
Good morning . Could I speak with Mr . Willard please ?
This is Chris Emerson speaking .
Can you tell me the differences between a letter and a memorandum , Miss Thong ?

Overseas operator , may I help you ?

Maybe we could do both !
I can't find the price tag .
But I heard other stores were having great mark-downs on this item .

Now , tell me , what do you eat ?
Do you eat a lot of vegetables ?
What do you drink ?

It's a coupe with a vinyl roof .

We are here .
The total is 45 yuan .
It is 45 yuan on the meter .
No . I am sure about that .
Excuse me . Would you mind trading seats with me ?
Oh , thank you . That ’ s very kind of you .
Do you plan to further your study ?
If you make every effort to the company , you will have a great chance to attend the on-the-job postgraduate . The tuition fee will be financed by our company .
Ahem ... uh , sir , I beg your pardon ... Uh , mister , are you waiting to buy a ticket for the movie ?
Well , yes , it is , but ...
You just cut into line , in front of me and everyone else , that's what ! Go take your place back at the end of the line , like every - one else !
Just what gives you the right ... ?
Well , you're no gentleman , either .
Whew ! I got the last one . This must be my lucky day !
Yes , I'm afraid I bought the last ticket , and to think , if you hadn't been such a gentleman . . .

Be careful . The floor is wet .

Have you ever thought about having children , Kaitlyn ?
Well , I've always wanted to have lots of children . Growing up with only one brother , I always felt a bit lonely . What do you think about families with only one child ?
Don't you think you would miss having other people around ?
If China didn't have such a policy , can you imagine how many people there would be in China now ?
Do you think most families with many children envy or feel sorry for other families with only one child ?
Ok , let ’ s go through this one more time . I don ’ t want anymore ruined or dyed blouses !
Right . You have to turn it on and program it depending on what type of clothes you are washing . For example for delicates , you should set a shorter washing cycle . Also , be sure to use fabric softener and this detergent when washing .
Since this is a white t-shirt , you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick .
No ! Since you are washing delicates and cotton , you should set the dryer to medium heat and for twenty minutes .

Take your time .
I ’ m surprised to hear you say so . You know that the cost of pro - duction has been skyrocketing in recent years .
Well , to get the business done , we can consider making some concessions in our price . But first , you ’ ll have to give me an idea of the quantity you wish to order from us , so that we may adjust our prices accordingly .
Well , as I ’ Ve said , if your order is large enough , we ’ re ready to reduce our prices by 2 percent .
How much do you mean then ? Can you give me a rough idea ?
Impossible . How can you expect us to make a reduction to that extent ?
Excuse me , you look lost.Can I help you ?
Right . Let me see . You go straight down here and turn right .
Then take the next left then the next right . Are you with me ?
I'm sorry , but I didn't catch what you said .

Yes , but they went to the public without any patent protection .
What can I do for you ?

What's a few ?
Did you pay your fines ?
How much are the parking tickets ?
That's expensive .
You should probably pay the fine soon .
Are you doing anything right now , Diana ?
Will you please cut it for a while and come in here to take a letter ?
Yes , this letter can't go into the mail any later than 5 . It's about a contract .
Please take a seat , Diana . Have you got your spare pens and pencils ?
No , I ’ d prefer not . I don't want any interruptions every other minute , but you can ask me at the end of the letter .
Of course , Diana . You'd better pay attention to the spelling when you type it .
Yes , that's fine . Now when you finish these , I want you to put these cards in alphabetical order , using the last names , and then make a list .
You're finally here ! What took so long ?
It's always rather congested down there during rush hour . Maybe you should try to find a different route to get home .
perhaps it would be better if you started taking public transport system to work .
It would be better for the environment , too .
Taking the subway would be a lot less stressful than driving as well .
Well , when it's nicer outside , you can start biking to work . That will give you just as much freedom as your car usually provides .
So , are you going to quit driving to work then ?
That's really convenient . We were wondering if you could take a little off the rent , though .
That's great . Every little bit counts . And we don't need the parking space . I guess we could rent it out .
That'll bring the price down to twenty-five . That's the price we were shooting for .

the air quality in this city is horrendous ! The pollution levels were so high that we weren't supposed to go outside with a face mask again !
on top of that , there are a few large chemical factories in the suburbs , which are contributing to the high pollution levels in the water and the air in this city .
I know what you mean . However , there are so few places left that have not been affected by global warming . If it's not the pollution , then it's the natural disasters , deforestation , or the greenhouse
it's the gradual rise in the earth's temperature .
they're related to one another , yes .
people joke about the benefits of the increase in temperature , but it's not all good news . They've been experiencing a lot of deadly storms there as well .

Those are the ones that are pre-dipped in sweet coating !
I think that you look very cute today .
What store did you get it from ?
I love your outfit right now .
Thanks . I found these new shoes earlier at the store .

Yes , I do . Do you accept American Express ?
Okay . Here's my VISA card .
Yes , it sounds like everything I expected .
Sandy , can you help me contact these people ?

Unless it ’ s marked differently , it ’ s their home numbers .
Then , you should e-mail them with the information .
They should have then listed on their resumes .
Then send them a SMS on their cell phone .
Yes . I called the first three people on the list , but they didn ’ t pick up .
I left a voice message on one---just for the first person on the list .
I told her that she should call me back at my office number .
Yes , that sounds like a good idea . She might not get the other message in time .
Sure . You can use this one . The pin number is written on the back of the card .
Great work . I ’ m off for the weekend ! See you on Monday .

Yes . We have an appointment at eight o ’ clock .
The environment varies greatly because of difference in language , customs and traditions .
But the importance of the export research is often neglected by the managers .
Therefore , when enterprises are spending a lot of money in trying to penetrate a new market , they should research whether their products can be sold at high enough a price and in a satisfactory amount .

Excuse me , is this the Auto Consumer Loan Center ?
Could you tell me something about the terms and interest rates for personal automobile consumer loan ?
I plan to take the loan for 3 years .
What about the loan repayment ?

Form your company's advertisement in the TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY , I learn that you are a foreign trade company of good service . I am interested in it.Here is my resume , ma'am .
Yes , I will graduate from the People's University of China this July majoring in International Trade.Besides , at school , I am a top student.Moreover , both my spoken and written English are pretty good .
I think I ' m qualified for the job if I can be given the chance.While at school , I once worked as part-time translator in a company and salesperson with a textile company for two years.And I don't mind being paid less from the start , I just want to enrich my experience and competence .
Yes , I do . I like traveling very much .
Of course , I'll try my best.When can I start working ?
Great.Let ' s start next week.Thank you , ma'am .
Excuse me . Do you mind telling me the time when the recruitment will officially start ?
Should I arrive early or on time ?
How do you like your overcoat , sir ?

We have settled the question of price , quality and quantity . Now I am calling to talk about the terms of payment . What are your terms of payment ?
I see . Payment by LC is the safest method , but could you make an exception and accept DA or DP ?
What about the cost of delivery ?
What may I help you with ?
What is your complaint about ?
When did this happen ?
What was taken ?
Did you get a good look at the person who robbed you ?
Would you able to pick him out of a line-up ?
Dad , I ’ d like to borrow some money .
Come on , Dad , I need thirty thousand . I wanna get into the market . You know , I ’ m tired of hearing all this news about the economic downturn , the inevitable recession , people stuffing their money in their mattresses . I look at this as an opportunity . This is a chance for me to get a jump start on building my nest egg .
But look at it this way , every challenge is an opportunity.And anyway , I ’ m not talking about investing in the domestic market . There are emerging markets that promise great returns . Look at China , for example.they have 1.4 billion people , half a billion of whom have recently entered the middle class . Here alone , the aggregate demand for consumer goods represents an amazing wealth generating opportunity .
Could you tell me a little about the organization ? For example , how big is your workforce here ?
I see . And how about the working hours ?
Well I am used to that , Mr . Parsons , so that ’ s not really a shock for me .

Two thousand hongkong dollars per night plus ten percent service charge and five percent government government tax .
But ladies , the room is not yet ready . There will be a delay of about half an hour . Perhaps you could fill in the registration form first , and then rest in our lobby for a while . We will let you know when the room is ready .

I'll do that , Mr.Zhang , See you tomorrow .
Where do you come from ?
What's the climate like in your country ?
What's the weather like in spring ?

I need to find a new furniture set for my living room .
I have no idea .
Where'd you get it from ?
How much did it cost you ?
Is the furniture sturdy ?
I don't mind paying a lot as long as the quality is good .
Which one of them is Marys brother ?
I'd like to meet him.Will you introduce him to me ?
What should be put in my education background ?
What do you mean by ' job intentions ' ?
What date would you like to depart , sir ?
Let's see ... I'm afraid the 16th is fully booked . But I have seats for the 17th .

What do you think of the project ?

Just to show your gratitude to the chance and tell them your impression on the company . And you can mention some details in your own interview to remind them of you .
Good morning , I made an appointment with Dr . Smith , but I have to change it .
My appointment was on Wednesday .
It was for 4
I want to change to next Tuesday .
I would prefer three o ’ clock in the afternoon .
Can I help you ?
There are so many here.The men with red hats are the porters .
Well , it depends how many pieces of luggages you have .
Have you read the new rules about using cell phone at work ?
Well , but for this one , don ’ t bring your cell phone to meetings , I think it is not reasonable . What if there are some important calls ?
Do you think we should travel by bus or by train ?
We could face delays if we travel by bus , thanks to traffic jams .
That's true.But I feel that I see more when I travel by bus .
So which form of transport do you prefer to use ?
Ok , then we'll go by train . I'm sure we'll have a good journey.Shall we go to the station and buy the tickets ?

Well , that sounds just wonderful .
Now darling , I know that we've bought this house together , but it's just going to be far too expensive to decorate it . I think we should sell it .
But we're going to spend so much money in furnishing and decorating . I think we could get a much cheaper place that's already furnished .
Well , only you liked it really , darling .
Hi , Bob , everything okay ?
Oh ? What's that ?
What gift ?
You refused the gift ? That's terrible .
Perhaps . He probably thinks you considered the gift a bribe for a higher grade .

Boy , oh boy ! I can't wait to change into my swim trunks .

Can I get you anything to drink ?

Sally , you look so corporate ! What interview do you have today ?
Yeah , I guess so . I've never actually heard of this one , but ...
You didn't read their brochure or anything , did you ?
Well , they are progressive and humanistic-maybe they don't care about nail polish ... uh ... even blue nail polish . Just keep your confidence up and you'll do great .
I'm calling to tell you that the merchandise ordered last month has not arrived yet .
Please find out the reason as soon as possible . We are in bad need of it .
I really want to make something for dinner .
I haven't the slightest clue what I'm going to make .

What's next ?
What's the next thing I need to do ?
How do I submit an expense report ?
You mean I have to attach the receipts with the expense report ?

Good morning . Madam . What can I do for you today ?
What seems to be the problem ?
Oh ? You mean , the ATM machine has eaten it ?
You said you received your card this morning , am I right ?
Did you receive your PIN number yet , Madam ? You see , unless you have your new PIN number , to match your new card , you cannot use it . We usually send that separately , around one day after the card , for security reasons .
Can you manage chopsticks ?
Good mastery . How do you like our Chinese food ?
What's wrong with MSG ? It helps to bring out the taste of the food .
Oh , don't let that worry you . If that were true , China wouldn't have such a large population .
Hi , Francis , how was your business trip ?
What ’ s up ?
Sounds quite fruitful , why do you call it still a nightmare then ?
This is really a sad story . Did they trace back your luggage ?
Do you have any seat preferences , sir ?
Yes . Would you like a window seat ?
morning . Rent-A-Car Agency . May I help you ?
Certainly , Mr . Alexander . When would Mr . Phillips like to leave ?
I'm calling today about a bill that I never received .

What am I supposed to do about my bill then ?
But if it's their mistake , can I get an extension on my bill payment ?
Okay , thank you very much for your help .
Jenny , don't you think it's really charming ?
Let's take our time and enjoy the art and sprite of the famous museum .

Well , you asked for it . Why don't you put on an Elvis song for him . He loves " The King . "
Here is the document you asked for this morning .
You ’ re welcome . You know , these days I have been reflecting on my biggest weakness procrastination . The more I think about it , the more I hate myself for being so disorganized . I decided to change the situation as soon as possible . Otherwise I will be more regretful later .
The most useful method is to make plans and set priorities . It helps me to manage time well and get the most important things done at the first place .
How are you doing , Jim ?
I think your presentation impressed the client , Daniel . You did a good job .
What's for lunch ?
What happened to you ?
Do you have any symptoms ?
Do you have a fever ?
It's not serious .

I don't mind . I'm not a light sleeper , but quieter is better for when we have to study at home .
Yes , if we're lucky we'll find something in the next few days . I think you had a good idea to start flat hunting early .
I don't think we can meet the delivery date you suggest . It's too soon .

So he said he'd sell me one for twenty dollars . A four-hundred-dollar camera for twenty bucks .
Yes .
I wanted to . But he said , no , the box is still in its plastic wrap from the store.If it's opened , other people won't believe it's new .
Yes , it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products.Look , it even had a bar-code price sticker on it ! It looked brand new .

You're welcome .
Tomorrow is my first day at work , what do you think I should be wearing ?
Indeed , I found most of the employees dress casually when I went to the interview . Only the manager was in suit and tie and he just came back from a ceremony . It seems that their dress code is not that formal . Probably , I should put on car key and simple shirt .

I've been reviewing your work over the past few months . Thanks to your excellent work , we benefit much from your project . And you should get the perfect attendance award too .
You are very modest and diligent . The distribution of bonus derived from the performance evaluation . You deserve it .
Donna ! How are you ? It's good to hear your voice .
So how are things in the land of the free and the home of brave ?
Things are so great here . I almost smiled myself to death last week . One of my coworkers had to give me CPR .
Or a curse .
That , my dear , was classic sales technique delivered by a professional .
Heck no , we doubled the price , but because it's you , I'll let you have'em at 50 off .
Hi . I ’ m here for flight 514 returning to Beijing but the board shows there is a delay.How long of a delay is expected ?
Do you think it ’ s safe to leave to get a quick bite ?
What seems to be the problem ?
I need to go to the ATM .
I have no idea how to use the ATM .
This will be my first time using an ATM .
Explain to me how to use it .
Now what do I do ?
Now what ?
Would you like something to drink ?
Of course we have lots of teas ?
What about a green tea or perhaps a jasmine tea ?
That ’ s Oolong tea – it ’ s a Cantonese tea .
May , is this the Hall of Ancient China ?
Why are they all in glass boxes ?
So there isn't air in the glass boxes ?
I wonder how old these things are , thousands of years ?
Hey , look at the three-leg cup . I've seen it on TV .
Yeah , it has no value at all . Who will use this cup today ?
I am so worried about this English contest . I have butterflies in my stomach now !
What would you like on your pizzas ?
Would you like anything to drink with that ? For $ 1.50 , you can get a two-liter bottle of Coke .
All right . That'll be $ 12.50 . Your pizzas will be there in 30 minutes .
We are redecorating and I'm going to add some things .
Shall we meet at 1:15 this Thursday ? We definitely need some new filing cabinets and at least one desk unit .
Can you tell me the way to library ?
Is it on Xinhua street ?
Comfort Inn , may I help you ?
You ’ re in luck ! We ’ re just a two-minute drive from there . Would you like to make a reservation ?
During the peak season , a single room goes for 50 dollars on a night . But we ’ Ve got a Single Super Saver Special going on right now – only $ 30 a night . And we ’ Ve also extended our checkout time 00 in
Yes , we have five meeting rooms , of various sizes . We can accommodate large meetings and small , informal gatherings as well . Of course , if you have many small meeting , you might consider checking
I am sorry to trouble you , but there's a lot of noise in the next room .
It's . I think , neighbours on the right .
I'm not sure , but I think so . I'm very exhausted , but I can't sleep .
Have you ever been to Xi ’ an ?
I ’ Ve heard many people saying that it is a place worth touring . I really want to see the old walls and terra-cotta warriors one day . Of course I won ’ t miss the local food either . You know , the sites interests a food in scenery , food is a key factor when visiting a place .
Sure it is . Is it convenient to get there by plane ?
A ticket to London , please .
Yes , including London Tube .
Doctor , what is the best way to stay healthy ?
It is very confusing to know what to eat .
Are there certain things that I should avoid ?
After watching my diet , what else should I do ?
Can I have a glass of wine now and then ?
Darling , I am back . What are you doing ?
B , should we get a maid ?
You have worked very hard in the office . If we can get someone to help you , you can have more rest .
You are a good wife , Julia . But you must take care of yourself .
Can I reserve a room from the 13th to the 18th ?
I'd like a suite . What's the rate ?
Is there anything I can do for you ?
I am sorry , sir . Your fish will be ready in five minutes so you can't change it .
Have you graduated now ?
Which university did you graduate from ?
What degree did you receive ?
What courses did you take in college ?
Why did you choose to study Economics ?
Can you speak other languages except English ?
I am very satisfied with your answers .
Once you arrive at the American airport , please call me .

Maybe I will be around later .
I am sorry , sir . I have broken the reading lamp in my room .
503 . I would like to pay for it .
OK , can you bring me a new one ?
Excuse me . I need to refill this prescription .
Yes , I need to refill it today .
I was worried about that . I couldn't remember if I had it refilled twice yet or not .
Listen . This is an emergency . I tried to call my doctor , but he is out of town . So I can't see him in time . I need this medicine . It is for skin condition . I've run out.Can you just refill it once more ?
But I need it . Please . Refill it for me just this once . I can go to the doctor around ten days from now . Then I'll have another prescription .
But I have a prescription . I just need more of it .
Oh , it will be so expensive ! I have a special medical plan , and I can only see one doctor.It will cost me a lot of money to see another doctor .
This is ridiculous ! In Taiwan , it is much easier to get medicine when I need it .
What are you doing ?
Let regive you a hand .
There are so many record players here . That is hard to choose .
I'd rather get one with separated speakers.They give a clear sound .
That's right . Now this one looks alright ? It's a detached or do you prefer this one ? It's Sony .
Ahhchooo !
No . Every spring time around April , I'm stricken with allergies .
Consider yourself lucky .
Well , as you just saw , I sneeze a lot . Also , my nose becomes very runny , my throat sometimes itches , and my eyes start to water .
No , it's not . So you don't have any type of allergies ?
Everyone to some extent is allergic to alcohol .
That's pretty bad .
Let's have a look at the map first .
Let's buy some tickets .
Well , it's not as crowded as we expected , is it ?
What do you do ?
I want to keep a pet , but I don't know which one to buy ?
Having a dog would probably be too much work for me , then .
Actually , I was thinking of something a little more exotic . I don't want a common pet like a dog or a cat .
Yeah , are they easy to look after ?
Can I be of any service to you ?
There are over a thousands kinds of articles in our shop.For example , there is tricolored pottery originating in the Tang Dynasty , embroidery , batik , jade carving , just to name a few.Do you have anything in mind ?
I would suggest you buy paper-cuts , embroidery and batik.They are very easy to carry .
Hey , Mary . We're back . Have you eaten yet ?
Let's go out for brunch .
It is a meal that combines breakfast and lunch . On Sundays , many Americans sleep late and go out for brunch . Those who go to church without having breakfast have brunch also .
Hi , my name is Sovia.What ’ s your name ?
What do you do ?
I ’ m a nurse.What do you do in your free time ?
I like to hang out with my friends , play games and go swimming .
Sure , that ’ d be great.Where would you like to go ?
Oh , I'm starving . I'd like to try some real Chinese cuisine . What would you recommend , waiter ?
They are both spicy hot , I've heard .
They might be too hot for me .
What about any special Beijing dishes ?
Oh , yes . I've heard a lot about it . I'd like very much to try it . Where can I find it ?
Is it near here ?
Well , thank you for your information . But what is the name of that restaurant again ?

Ant Shirley , it's being years since we last met . How were you doing in the passing years ?
Fine . Where are the other guys ?
Bad timing . I want to see them so much . How are they ?
Yes , that's why I'm here . I'm thinking about buying a second-hand apartment .
No , that will be too expensive .
My first job's salary will be a bit low . So the cheaper the better . Just one I can afford .
Good afternoon .
Thank you .
It ’ s half past twelve .
From one to two .
We usually go to the cafeteria .
Merry Christmas , Bill .
What are you doing there on the computer ?
That's pretty interesting . Did you get one from Haven ? The reason I ask is that I am looking for her number .
Yeah , that would be great . Thanks .
Thanks million .
There are so many eating utensils on the table . Which ones do I use first ?
I see . A set for appetizers and another for the main course .
Oh yeah . The big napkin goes on my lap .
Cindy , help me order because I'm still not very familiar with American cooking .
It was nice talking to you .
I really have to go .
I have things to do .
Don't be nosey .
Well , it's really none of your business .
I'm sorry , but I have to go .
Mom , will you have time to help me with my homework today ?
Well , Peter , you have to do better than that next time , won ’ t you ?
Of course , you have . You must try harder this time .
No , you needn ’ t do that . You ’ d better get a part-time job somewhere and go to evening classes .
You ought to have worked harder then you wouldn ’ t have failed your exams . You have to take a job and study .
How do you do ?
My name is Wang Liang , I ’ m from Beijing . Where do you come from ?
You're from Tangshan ? I can't believe my ears . I was also born in Tangshan , but I was brought up in Beijing .
Just over 4 years now . Since this is your first day here , I'm sure you don't really know too much yet . Let me show you around , so you can introduce yourself to everyone .
Hello , Parker . How's everything ?
Business is booming . I understand you want to meet up with me next week . How's your schedule look ?

Great idea !
Thank you so much .
I have difficulty with this form . Will you please explain it to me ?
Do you develop films here ?
Well , the 4 x 6 is fine .
The last one is black and white , all the rest should need color .
I hope they will come out well . When should I pick them up ?
Yes , it is . And develop them as glossy as possible .
Yes , a roll of Kodak film please .
How come it is slow as a snail today ?
Yes , I wanted to look for some information on the company page just now . It took me almost one minute to open it . Then there is no response for any click .
I need help . I think my arm is broken .
No , I haven't . I need help quick . It hurts really badly .
Let me see a doctor .
I thought this was the emergency room .
No . Only a little . I fell off my porch .
My left arm .
No , I can't . I'm left-handed .
Yes . But why do I have to fill out a form anyway ? This is the emergency room .
No . Just let me see a doctor . I'm worried about my arm .

Hi ! Is that the new laptop you brought last week ? It looks very nice .
Here ? In this cafe ? How can you do that ?
That ’ s great . Can you do it anywhere ?
So , what programs do you have on your laptop ?

Here's the money , keep the changes , please .
Janice , I can't find the document I was working on last month . Can you help me to look for it ?
Yes , but I still can not find it . Maybe it is in this cabinet .
I am sure that document was filed .
Good idea ! It seems that I asked you to put it in Nova's files .
What would you have ?
What about this dry red ? It's good indeed , it never goes to the head .
Here it is .
Are you planning on voting ?
I will be voting tomorrow .

I found some jeans , and a new blouse .
What do you think ?
What about the jeans ?
I don't think so either .
Well , I'll just buy the shirt .
Now , Miss Childs passed on your resume to me and I ’ Ve had the chance to look it over and I must say I ’ m quite impressed .
Well yes , I do have a number of questions , but perhaps first you could give me a brief overview I ’ d like to get a little bit of an idea of your background .
Ah I see , so you were actually educated in Europe ?
Very interesting . So it seems you had quite an adventurous childhood .
Can you tell me , Ms . Smith , about the training programs you initiated this year ?
What ’ s the result ?
That seems very impressive . Good work !
Well , good morning , Tom . I haven't seen you for a long time .
What seems to be the trouble now ?
Have you been eating properly ? Eating the right kind of food is important for your health , you know .
And what about dinner ?
That's not good . You don't have a well-balanced diet . Have you been taking vitamin pills ?

Doctor , I have the worst toothache !
For about a week or so , but it ’ s gotten really bad in the last couple of days .

what happened ? Why didn't he win ?
how did that happen ? He's so talented ! I thought he had a great chance of winning a gold medal !
what ? What kind of drugs was he using ?
I thought that all athletes were supposed to be regularly tested for drugs .
that's so disappointing . I don't know why top athletes would feel the need to take drugs .
regardless of how much pressure you're under , there's never a good reason to take drugs .
I need to use the ATM .
I ’ m not sure how .
I ’ Ve never used one before .
What do I have to do ?
Then what ?
What do I have to do next ?
What are you doing ? Checking the " to do " list for the wedding ?
So let's start by checking off what we've already done .
Not yet , I was busy getting that videographer who films stuff for the Net .
It is my first time coming to China . I want to buy something unique of China to my friends as gifts .
Yes , I love them , but they are fragile . It is not convenient to take them .
Sounds good . May I have a look ?
They are beautiful , but I can't understand the connotation in them . Let me see the handkerchiefs .
Oh , I like the bamboo design . What is this ?
Good . So I will take three series and five bamboo ones .
Can you make out what he's saying ?
Excuse me .
Can you tell me the way to the Peak Tram , please ?
Along Queen's Road ...
Right at the Hilton .
The Cathedral ?
That's very kind of you . Thank you . Er ... have you got a pencil ?
Hi , Nally , are you hungry ?
Where to ?
Are you kidding ? That place is too ritzy for lunch .
Same thing , meals there all coarsen arm and leg .
Let's stop it at Multicolor for a quick lunch ..
That was a great lunch , the food was good , but the service was lousy .
Good morning , sir .
Do you have a particular style in mind ?
I think you should realize that even the most conservative style changes .
The changes are usually not that dramatic . We just got some pictures of the latest fashion . Would you like to take a look ?
Next Friday .
Oh , gosh ! I feel everything around me is against me .
Well , I am all ears . Maybe they are helpful .
I understand what you mean , and I will not upset myself . Face it .
Look , Mary ! There are so many people over there !
I have never been to the personnel market .
Are there many employers ?
So there will be many large companies in the personnel market , right ?
When will there be a job fair ?
Do I need to pay to go into the personnel market ?
How about going there to have a look now ?
Could you show me the T-shirt on the model ?
What's the price ?
Can you make it any cheaper ?
I'll take it if you give me a discount .
Hello , again . Did you discuss everything with your colleagues ?
Have you decided how you would like the salaries paid ?
That's not a problem .
I think this spring is a good time for us to start looking .
I know , dear . I am too . But we've just been too busy to look for a house .
Not necessarily . If we use a realtor to find a house , it will be more expensive .
Realtors always get a commission.If the realtor helps us find something , we have to pay him .
Yes , that's often true . But you have to pay them .
Of course we need a home inspector.But we can hire an inspector on our own.And as for the legal problems , I have friends . They can help us .
It takes a little more time . We have to check the ads in the paper.Probably also there are special real estate magazines with ads.Then we have to drive to the homes and look at them .
Sometimes they do , sometimes they don't . It's best to find someone who is selling by themselves .
Because if the seller has a realtor , their price will be higher.He will have to pay a commission to the realtor .
It is . But buying a house is very important . So it takes time.That ' s why we haven't done it yet . It's very troublesome .
I'm calling about our appointment . I can't call on you this evening.My wife is terribly ill .
How about next week ?
Which restaurant do you prefer ?
How about the one on Baker Street ?
The numbers in this table don't seem to be in accord with reality .
Oh , so the zoo is over there . Thank you so much for your help .
I ’ m actually travelling around Asia .
Probably another week .
Could you type up this document for me , Sandra ?
Are you interested in mountaineering ?
I'm the same with you , an amateur mountain climber . I went climbing in the Rocky Mountains with my friends last summer vacation . We spent two days in the mountains .
We pitched a tent in the night , waiting for the sunrise . Wow ! It was too beautiful .
Tasha Mountain ? It's very famous in China , isn't ?
I want to climb Tasha Mountain this summer vacation . Would you be my guide ?
Sir , what's wrong with you ?
Have you ever suffered from airsickness before ? You're probably airsick .
OK . I will get some for you . There's an airsickness bag behind the seat in front of you.Please wait me for a moment . ( Go away for a few minutes , and now she comes back . ) Here are two pills . And the water is in the glass too.Please take the pills with water .
Are you feeling better now ?
Hi Bill , it ’ s Jane .
Sure .
Have you decided what you'd like ?
And then ?
Good morning , Madam . What can I do for you ?
Maybe sandalwood fan is good .
Of course .
The small ones are one hundred yuan for each . And the big ones are two hundred and thirty yuan .
What else are you interested in ?
Good morning.Mrs.Smith .
Well , what kind of books does she like ?
I see.Has she read any detective stories ?
Do you know if she's read this one ?
Ah ! She has a bad memory.How old is she ?
I suggest you take this book.It ' s very exciting .
Hey , Jimmy , you've been sitting in front of the TV all day . Anything interesting on TV ?
Why don't you turn off the TV and get outside ? You need to get some fresh air .
Really ? What's the series about ?
It sounds interesting , but I am not a big fan of TV shows . They're time consuming and don't have much depth .
Really ? that's interesting !
Hello , hot water overflowed from the bathtub . Would you help me ?
I did it .
Ok , I will .
I am sorry , I was too tired to fall asleep .
Hi . I'm looking for a gift for my niece .
That's perfect . I want to see one .
Oh , I like Digital Barbie ! How much does she cost ?
That's perfect . Let me have her .
No , that'll do it for now .
Let me give you cash , please .
Please put your baggage on the counter and open it , let me have a look .
Anything subject to duty in your suitcase ?
Any cigarettes or liquor ?
I think you'll have to pay some duty on these cigarettes because they exceed the quota . And this article is liable for duty .
One hundred dollars .
Just a moment . I'll make out your duty memo . ( Writing and giving the memo to Mr . Green ) Take it and pay the girl over there .
So that concludes the introduction . Now let's move to the first part of my talk , which is about 2006 fiscal year marketing plan . So first , right off the bat , When looking at the marketing plan , tell me some of the goals that we had set this year to begin with ...
Excuse me , sir , may I talk to you ?
Well sir , as you know , I have been an employee of this prestigious firm for over ten years .
I won ’ t beat around the bush . Sir , I would like a raise . I currently have three companies after me and so I decided to talk to you first .
I understand your position , and I know that the current economic downturn has had a negative impact on sales , but you must also take into consideration my hard work , pro-activeness and loyalty to this company for over a decade .
Great ! It ’ s a deal ! Thank you , sir !
Are you going to vote on Tuesday ?
I ’ Ve already voted .
I sent in an absentee ballot .
I won ’ t be able to vote on Tuesday .

I have important business to take care of that morning .
How would you describe your ideal job ?
Why do you think you might like to work for our company ?
What makes you think you would be a success in this position ?
How do you know about this company ?
Did you see the picture of the guy on the front page of the newspaper this morning ?
you've got to see it . It's an unbelievable picture !
Well , this guy fell asleep on the sofa and when he woke up , half his face had been bitten off !
They think his dog was trying to wake him up and couldn't , so ended up biting him in his face .
It looks pretty frightening . He doesn't have any lips , so all you can see are his gums and teeth . Most of his nose and chin are missing too .
He was actually quite handsome . What a shame .
Excuse me . We're leaving today . I'd like to pay our bills now .
I see .
Yes , my friend and I just had breakfast at the dining room , but we didn't use any services .
Please add to my account .
I'm not sure about how to operate the washer and dryer .
I need help turning them on .
The machines take change ?
Where do i put the money in ?
That's it ?
Thank you very much .
Dad , can you lend me some money ?
I want to get a ticket for a concert tonight .
How much money do you expect in this position ?
Well , it is a little more than we had planned .
Could you help me with these books ?
Please , George .
I firmly believe that if we invested in funds we could earn a lot of money .
Good afternoon , sir . What can I do for you ?
No problem . Please wait a minute . ( She goes to the back for a few minutes . ) Here is your medicine , sir . Take two tablets after each meal and once before bed .
Yes , our over-the-counter medicine is over there on that shelf .
Yes , right over here .
Here's a twenty .
How long do we stop over here ?
What for ?
Can we get off the plane ?
Do you have anything to declare ?
OK . You'll have to pay duty for the whisky .
Please wait a moment . I'll make out the duty memo . Here you are . Take this and pay the people over there .
Very well . I hope you'll enjoy your stay in China .
The skirt looks beautiful . Can I try it on ?
Well , I think this one is a little too small . Would you please bring me a bigger one ?
I want to reserve rooms for my colleagues .
A single room with a bath and one double room facing the lake .
Hi ! Fiona ? I almost didn't recognize you . You are much thinner since I last saw you .
How did you do it ?
What's the secret then ?
Well . It's hard for me . I can't keep doing exercise .
Excuse me . Can I open a postal savings account in your office ?
Hum .. Can you recommend me one with high interest ?
I want the one with the highest interest rate .
All right . I'II open this one .
What kind of cuisine do you have ?
Hangzhou food .
All right . I'll take it .
Yes , I like using chopsticks .
Yes , but I don't know what soup you have .
Good . I prefer beef soup .
Save it until you've served dishes .
Excuse me , is there a department store near here ?
Where ’ s Wang Fu Jing ?
Thank you .
How much is it to rent an economy car ?
Could I have one for tomorrow morning ?
Sure here it is .
Why is there water all over the bathroom floor ?
Can I help you ?
I am sorry . We are full up for tomorrow .
Yes , the Sunset Hotel is three blocks away . Maybe you can ask them .
