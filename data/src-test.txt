The taxi drivers are on strike again .
They want the government to reduce the price of the gasoline .
We've managed to reduce our energy consumption in our factory by about 15 per cent in the last two years .
Mainly because we've invested in a heat recovery system .
Well , we use the exhaust gases from our printing presses to provide energy to heat our dryers .
Believe it or not , tea is the most popular beverage in the world after water .
Right . And China is the homeland of tea .
Do you know there are several catagories of Chinese tea ?

Oh , so do I .
Great . We can chat while enjoying a cup there .

so , shall we allow three hours to cover the distance ?
no . let me take a look ... it ’ s longer than my car .

So how did I do on my driving test ?
Of course , I do .
How bad did I do ?
How ?
What were they ?
Can I have another try ?
Good morning . What's the matter with you ?
All right , young man . Tell me how it got started .
Don't worry , young man . Lat me give you an examination . First let me take a look at your throat . Open your mouth and say'ah ' .
Your throat is inflamed . And your tongue is heavily coated . You have all the symptoms of influenza .
A good rest is all you need , and drink more water . I'll write you a prescription .
My dear , what's for supper ?
What about soup ?
Which condiment do you use for ?
Very good , need I help you ?
Thanks . I can watch TV now .

Anything wrong with it ?
Oh , how awful ! May I have a look at the invoice ?
Well . please accept our sincere apologies , I'll be glad to change it for another one if you wish .

Of course . A two-week paid vacation a year , a five-day workweek .
Next , please . Hello , may I help you , sir ?

we really were lucky . We got the last available table for two---and we didn't even have a reservation ! Did you see the long lines behind us ?
let's take a look at the menu so we can order . Do you want to choose an appetizer for us to share ?
I heard that one of their specialities is the samosa .
sounds good . What are you going to have for your main course ?
what's in a dahl ?
that sounds nice . Do you want to share some kebabs as well ?
that's my favourite . Do you want to have some wine or beer ?
ok , shall I flag down the waitress ?
you're right . That might seem a bit rude . It's a good thing I've got you with me !
This position demands a higher writing ability , so please say something about your writing ability .
pompous . How may I help you ?
How large a group are you expecting ?
Would you like to reserve a private dining room ?
All right . May I have your name , Sir ?
Ms . Wang , this is Mr . Cooper , president of Ivy Publishing .
Nice to meet you , Ms . Wang . You must be exhausted after your long trip from Canada .
Can you help me now ?
That'll be too late .
Have you got any experience in advertising ?
Do you have any practical experience as a secretary ?
Would you tell me the essential qualities a secretary should maintain ?
Have you had any experience with computer ?
That's fine . What about operating the fax and duplicator ?
What have you learned from jobs you have held ?
Hi , Dan . What's new ?
I went to Salt Lake City on business . What's up ?
How come ? Last time I saw you . You told me it was a good job , and you'd like to take it as a career . That was only one month ago . Why this sudden change ?
What are you going to do now ?
That's not the way to solve the problem . Did you look in the classified advertisements column ?
Listen . I will see what I can do , ok ? You go home and tell Lily about this problem you have now . She is your wife and I am sure she will understand .
Have you ever gotten a parking ticket ?
I got a ticket yesterday .
I parked in the red zone .
I needed to get something really quick .
At my apartment building .
I needed to be fast .
How may I help you ?
What problem are you having ?
Do you have the statement for your card ?
What are the charges you ’ re referring to ?
I ’ m afraid we ’ re going to have to investigate these charges .
I honestly don ’ t know , but we will freeze payment on these charges .
Good afternoon . Can I be of service ?
Yes , of course . We have Treasury Notes with two , three and five-year terms available .
OK , could I take a look at some ID please , like a passport ?
Hey . Why did you take that money ? You are such a cheater ! I should send you to jail !
Well you can ’ t just take the money . You have to ask the bank for money . And I ’ m the banker .
Yes ...
Hi , is this Professor Clark ’ s office ?
Hi , this is Kalina from your morning literature class .
I had a skydiving accident over the weekend and won ’ t be able to come to school today .
I broke my leg , but it is healing .
I should be able to return by next Monday .
Good afternoon ! Did you call for a plumber ?
I see . Let me have a look . It seems that your toilet is clogged , and that ’ s why it won ’ t flush . Let me just get my plunger . No , that ’ s not working either . I suspect that there ’ s some sort of foreign object in the pipes that ‘ s causing a blockage . That ’ s what ’ s making your toilet overflow .
Yeah , I have a little one myself . Anyway , these water pipes are really rusty , so they also should be changed . Thatcould be causing water to not drain completely , that might lead to more problems in the future . I would also suggest fixing this faucet that isn ’ t shutting off properly . I could have it all finished by today if it ’ s urgent .
Listen , Karen , I need your help . I don't know anyone here yet .
My mother-in-law just went into the hospital in L.A.Hank and I will be flying there tonight .
Doctors aren't sure yet.But the real problem is Suzy . She has a bad cold , and we don't want to take her with us . But we don't know who can stay with her .
Yes , I'd ask Jill , the girl I've had before , but I need someone overnight.Maybe even for two nights .
I don't want to do that to you , Karen .
Your own kids would get Suzy's cold . I think it would be better to have a good babysitter here . But I don't know who to ask . I need someone more mature than Jill . It might even be for two or three days .
I'd like to talk with her.This is short notice , I know . But Hank and I are leaving tonight .
I'm glad you know someone . I knew you would be the best person to ask about this . I don't want to insult Jill or her mother . I think Jill maybe could do it.But I'd rather have someone a little older .
Good evening . What'll you have ?
Draft beer and cans beer . Which do you prefer ?
OK . Here you are .
Hello , Mr . Black , how are you ?
Very well , thank you . It's nice to meet you again . I am awfully sorry for not being able to meet you at the airport , as I was busy yesterday . I do hope you had a very enjoyable trip from New York .
How are you getting along with your business ?
By the way miss , where is the toilet ?
What ? Oh , what we live ! Thank you very much for your help , miss .
xcuse me , could you tell me which line I ’ m supposed to stand in to buy bubble wrap and to post a package ?
that ’ s a really long line . How long do you think it ’ ll take to get through all those people ?
can I buy stamps here ?
I need 30 for my Christmas cards .
twenty of them are going abroad to China and America .
no .
and the bubble wrap ?
Good evening , Saliva . What's that wonderful aroma from your kitchen ? What are you doing now ?
Are you good at cooking ?
It is a good idea . What dish are you cooking now ? !
Yes , I have . But the taste of steamed fish at that restaurant is not delicious . The fish is not well-done and too salty .
I have the same idea as yours .
Thank you . Oh , it's very delicious .
Besides steamed fish , what else are you good at cooking ?
So many dishes . Next Friday week is my birthday . I would like to invite you to cook for my dinner party , OK ?
Thanks a lot .

I'd like you to do me a favor .
Can you mail this at the post office for me ? I have to go to the doctor for an appointment and I don't have enough time to go to the post office .
Excuse me , may I help you ?
Sure . Which kind of gas do you want ?
I'll be willing to come and talk about the financing of our imports .
What about a draft at 120 days sight ?
A bank's acceptance will add to the costs of our imports . You can rest assured that we will accept the draft and honour it when it comes due .
I hope this transaction will pave the way for further business relations between our two countries .
There's a new girl in school , have you seen her yet ?
I think that she is very pretty .
She's kind of short .
She's probably about five feet .
The first thing I noticed was her beautiful brown eyes .
Are you telling me that you've seen her before ?
Take a seat inside and see what you think.So you will take the Porsche then , sir ?
You're smart to buy it . At 45 dollars for three days , it is a good deal .
San Francisco ? No , sir.We only have this office here . You will have to return it here .
No , sir . That's only with the very big companies . I'm sorry , but this car must be returned to this lot .

Wait . Let me tell the lady what we would like to order in front of the seafood fridge first .
Where do you want to go ?
Get in . I'll take you .
It will cost you $ 10 .
You can see the time on the meter . I have radio time , you know .
You're made a good choice . This china tea set is unusual .
It was made in Jingdezhen .
You are right .
It is the best quality porcelain-the famous egg-shell China .
Hello , Miao Li , Where are you going ?
Oh , Would you do me a favor ?
Please mail this letter for me on your way to the store .
Yes , I think so . There are some pictures in it . It would be a great pity if they were lost .
Thanks .
I have a cell phone in my car . Now it's probably on the floor on the passenger side.Why don't you get it for me , and then I can call the police ?
It doesn't work . It looks like it's broken . I need to get to a hospital . You should drive me there .
Damn it ! I'm injured here . We could wait all day for the police .
It really hurts .
To hell with you . The accident was your fault .

Hi , George . I'm going to have a job interview next week . Could you give me some advice ?
Yeah , that's very important .
I ’ ll try my best to make a good impression on the interviewer .
It ’ s always easier to say something than to do it .
But I love wearing T-shirts and jeans .
It ’ s a pity that I cannot afford more expensive clothes .
I know what you mean . I ought to wear right clothes at the right time .
It seems that ' clothes make the man ' .
The boss announces the pay raise today , right ? How much do you think we'll get ?

Yes , can you tell me what's my responsibility in this position ?
I see . This is my advantage .

well , to be honest , there's another reason . I've got a better offer .
the head office is in New York , but I'll be dealing with overseas companies and flying to this side of the world from time to time .

What can I show you ?
Let me check . Yes , we have .

Do you take credit cards ?
OK , here you are .
OK .
Thank you .
You look upset , anything wrong ?
Why ?
You'd look before you leap .

We've never expected that Shanghai is such a big metropolis , same as New York city . David , would it be a good idea to rent a car here ? I've got an international driver's license with a pretty good record in the States .
This house is not looking all that great from here
I don ’ t think that it is looking any better inside here .

How many dogs live in this house ?
Excuse me , waiter , I would like to have some wine before the main course .

Are you going to buy a bicycle ?
¥ 350 .
Your discount is already included . Normally we charge ¥ 400 , but now we can give you a special price . This is our sale period .
Sorry , but this is the best price . You can ’ t get it any cheaper than here .
Do you have a free moment ?
I'm having some trouble . How do you use this printer ?
Silly me .
Oh , and it's out of paper . Do you have any more ?
I need help using the washer and dryer .
I can't figure out how to turn them on .
I didn't know I needed change .
Where do I put the change ?
Is that everything that I have to do ?
I appreciate you helping me with this .
Do you have any questions ?

Here is the draft contract , Mr . Brown . Let's discuss the clauses to see if we agree on all of them . Then I will make out an original of the contract . After that , what's left is to fill out the contract and sign our names .
The contract is to be written in Chinese and English . Both languages are equally effective .
Thank you .
That's a good idea .
Agreed .
I want to buy a black suit .
I prefer single breasted suit .
How do you do ? Nice to meet you , Diane .
Well , I think you ' Ve reconsidered our proposal , Diane .
I should not be surprised , many customers have the same opinion . Do you have any suggestion in mind ? Our salesman told your secretary that the price could be negotiable .
That's true . But if you understand that quality is the most important aspect of a product , you'll agree that 679 is not high , especially when we allow you a 10 % discount .
Well , considering the quantity of your order we could further reduce the price to 600 . That's the best we can do . What do you think of that ?
Don't I know you ?
You're Mr.Stevenson , right ?
That's all the general information of our company . I think you already have good knowledge about our company .
When we have the final results , we will call you .
If you pass the interview , the personnel department will inform you within two weeks .
I'm sorry we won't . You can wait for two weeks . If you don't get a telephone call , it means that you weren't successful .
I'm sorry but I can't make the final decision myself , and I have to discuss it with other interviewers .
Your mentality is very good and that's great .
I have a stomachache .
What kind of personality do you think you have ?
Do you think you are introverted or extroverted ?
What do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy ?
What kind of people do you like to work with ?
I would like to take this opportunity to welcome Monica to our company and introduce her to her department and colleagues . For all of you , we hired Monica because she is a very professional accountant and we are very happy to have her in the finance department . She has lots of working experiences as an accountant and I am sure everybody in the department can benefit from this .

I will go to bed early tonight .
I don't know . But I have a carsickness .
Can we choose a time to look at houses together ?
Either way is good for me .
I can take a little time off of work , or I can go on a weekend , also .
I am leaving from work , so maybe I could just meet you at the first house that we will look at .
I would like to see as many as possible .

but it looks good . Let me try it on .
What can I do for you , miss ?
Do you like high heels or flat shoes ?
Hi Jim . Do you have a minute ?
Some of us are going to start a soccer team . Would you like to join us ?
That ’ s all right . We ’ ll teach you .
Not very much . It ’ s something like hockey , except that you use a big ball and no stick .
Do you remember what the ratings of movies stand for ?
Does anyone pay any attention to those ratings anymore ?
I remember that I never saw an X moves even displayed .
Yea , I never see theaters turn people away for their age anymore either .
Why aren't you doing well in the class ?
Reservation , can I help you ?
Wait a moment , please . Let me check it .
Right now we have a suite for 4 people , do you want to book it ?
Hey Mel ! Are you up for some tennis today ?
You sound exhausted . Maybe you should hire a nanny to help you out ! She can pick the kids up and take them to their after-school activities . She can also help you do some household chores , and run so
I think you should definitely consider it ! This way you won ’ t have to juggle such a busy schedule , and you ’ ll still get to spend time with the kids in the evenings . I can refer you this great
Can you tell that I ’ m excited ?

Have you a pattern in your mind ?
Is there any special brand you would like ?

It is largest pop square in the world.you see that is monument for the people's hero , and the Chairman Mao memorial hall on the south.there is great hall of the people on the west.there are two museums on the east .
That's the Forbidden city on the north of Gate building .
I ran it against that fence pole as I crashed . What do you think ? Damn , it hurts !
I'm lucky I wasn't killed . I must have been going around forty-five miles an hour.There was too much gravel on that corner . I slid out .
Make it tighter . I want the blood stopped.Then wrap some bandages around the cut . Then we can go . Ouch ! I hope I can walk .
Mr.James . I know that office hour is up now , but could you work during the weekend and finish the translations ?

The chef trained in Florence . The pasta is very good here .
Hum ... You should try the mushroom fettucine . It's really good .
Not at all . It has a very delicate flavor .

Mr . Crandall , I ’ m sorry , but I really don ’ t see the value in doing this entire project over from scratch . It would take a lot of work .
I agree . But I think that we can handle the problem by making a few major changes . I ’ d appreciate it if you would give me a chance .
I think it's time for me to meet my admirer and make him face the music .

Can I try this one on ?
So Dick , how about getting some coffee for tonight ?
Come on , you can at least try a little , besides your cigarette .
You guys are charging me $ 10 for a movie that I never ordered or saw .
Well , the wrong information is in my file . I was at a concert Monday night .
I knew you'd see it my way .
Am I in the Twilight Zone ? You're charging me for a movie I never saw ?
This is highway robbery . I've got a good mind to call the police !
Mr . Carter has asked me to come over to invite you to the banquet held in your honor at the Shangri-La Hotel at 7:00 this evening . Here's an invitation for you .

Hello . I bought a China dress in your shop this morning .
I bought it one size up by mistake .
I wonder if you can change it to one size down .
Then I'll come to your place later in the evening , and how late is your shop open ?
The boss announces the pay raise today , right ? How much do you think we'll get ?
It better be more than last year .
I'm going to go shopping for groceries in a little bit .
I believe we are all out of food .
I don't know what we need .
I would appreciate it if you would do that for me .
What do you mean ?
Go make that list .
Hello , take a seat please . Let's get straight to the point . This is our contract . Please read it carefully before signing .

Were you able to attend Friday night's basketball game ?
You should have been there . It was intense .
Our team was victorious .
It was a great game .
Our team won 101-98 .
That's the reason it was such a great game .
Have you ever tried shopping online ?
That's right . Seeing is believing .
That happens . Without close quality examination , we may encounter fraud , and the e-shop may suddenly disappear .
It's said that some measures have been taken to deal with this problem . Paying online is much safer than before , but I still have the feeling that it's not safe enough .
Me too . Sometimes I surf online shops to check some related information , and then go to a physical store to do the actual shopping .
How long does it take to get to downtown from here ?
What companies do we have in our neighborhood ?
Does the 7th floor belong to our company too ?

Where did the break-in happen ?
Was anything taken ?
What makes you think there was a break-in ?
I'll send a squad car .
Good morning , everyone . Let me introduce myself to you ...
Well , thank you very much but I thought l'd try and chair the meeting by the rule — at least for a while .
Now , I'd like to get things under way . The main topic on today's agenda is the development of a U . S . sales strategy for the new EBB . I'd like to hear all of your ideas , Mr . Wall , you seem in top form today . Could you start the ball rolling ?
Well , that's kind of obvious .
I'm sorry , but I don't think this damage is our fault .
It looks like the shipping company did this .
I ’ m glad you could find time to meet with me , Mr . Johnson . I can ’ t think of a nicer environment for our meeting today , the ambiance here is lovely !
Well , as you know , I have recently become the sole distributor for Grangers Gourmet Bon-bons here in the United States . They ’ re a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market . Naturally , your restaurant sprang into my mind immediately . I think your brand exemplifies many of the same traits as Grangers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant , luxurious , first class dining .
Actually , the factory is located in Scotland .
That ’ s what makes this such a fantastic opportunity ! The government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units . They ’ Ve also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well . Here , I brought these especially for you , try one !
Unique , aren ’ t they ? I bet you ’ Ve never tasted anything like it ! Quality is assured as I personally visit the factory to make sure no one ’ s cutting corners with the ingredients . Only the creme make it through inspection .
I have it on highest authority that this traditional secret recipe has been handed down in the Granger family for generations . I ’ m sure you can keep a secret . Buttermilk , cacao beans , sugar and Haggis .
It ’ s a traditional Scottish delicacy , you take sheep ’ s liver , heart and lung and stuff it inside of the sheep ’ s stomach .
Do you need a guide ?
It's $ 20 . If you are staying for more than 3 days in the city , the charge is $ 16 per day .
Aren't you Jim Green ?
I believe we met at a concert last year . I'm Taylor .
Lucy , I ’ d like to fix the light in the corridor , it keeps flashing , which drives me crazy . Would you like to help me with the ladder ?
I think I can handle it by myself .
I see . If I got hurt when fixing the light , even during office hours , I wouldn ’ t get compensation from our company since repairing is not my responsibility .
Like this one ? Never wear loose clothes or hair when operating the shredder.Yeah , thank you for telling me .
Thank God ! I am finished writing that service guide ! It took me forever !
This morning ! No more overtime , and no more headaches !
I didn ’ t receive an unemployment check this week and need to know why .
I am afraid that I forgot to send it in .
Is it too late to mail the Continued Claim Form in now ?
I will mail it in a little early next time to avoid this problem .
Will my paycheck arrive late because I messed up on my form ?
I should tell you that I'm checking out in about 30 minutes .
Very good ! Now , it's still morning here in New York .
I'm going to spend some time exploring the city . What can I do with my luggage ?
A deposit ? Isn't my luggage a deposit ?
Okay . Let me think about this .
May I take your order ?
And what would you like after that ?
It's the latest and quite popular among young people .
Sure . Here is your receipt .
Hey honey , how was your day ?
Why ? What happened ?
Yeah , you ’ re right . We aren ’ t getting any younger and our kids are getting older .
Sounds good , although , do you think we can qualify for insurance ? Those insurance companies are real pirates when it comes to money .
I wish our company or country provided us with healthcare .
Hello . Can you tell me what the procedures of applying for a job are ?
What is the qualification needed by the position ?
What did you do today ?
Did you win ?
I'd like to withdraw some money from my account .
Sure .
Can I have a look at that digital camera please ?
How much does it cost ?
It looks pretty good . I think I'll take it .
I need something to wash this down . Is there any juice in the fridge ?
It's a green drink . It's supposed to be full of vitamins and minerals .
The sales lady said that even if I eat right , I wouldn't get enough vitamins .
It's easier to drink this once a day than eat fruit and vegetables all day .
Billy , you are late again .
Yes he ' s in his office .
Don't take any chances . It'd be best if you told him and promised not to be late again . He's already mad at you for last 2 times . Any more and he might fire you .
I think he might . You'd better go to his office .
How much is the rent ?
And how much is the deposit ?
Is there anything else , apart from the Credit Rating and Debt to Asset Ratio ?
Right , OK . That , again , shouldn't be a problem .
Well , as far as I can tell , we qualify .
Do you understand any other foreign languages besides English ?
What band did you pass in Japanese Language Proficiency Test ?
What seems to the trouble Mr Brown ?
Oh , In what way .
Did you lose any weight ?
when was the last time you have track up ?
Let me take your blood pressure . You look anilic . Well , Mr.Brown . I ’ m happy to say it ’ s nothing serious . You just a little run down from overwork .
I think you ’ ll needs just vacation . Try to get out doors more . I ’ ll be sure if you get more rest .
May I see your passport , please ?
You are here on business , I think ?
How long will you be staying ?
How many pieces of baggage have you got ?
Do you intend to take it out on your departure ?
According to the regulations , the camera you've brought along for personal use can be passed for the time being duty free , but you will have to take it out with you when you leave the country .
Well . Have a pleasant stay in Germany .
Excuse me . What should be included in my CV ?
What kind of personal information ?
May I come in ?
Nice to meet you , Mr . Peter . I ’ m Wang Sian . I ’ Ve come for an interview as requested .
Thank you .
I majored in Public Relations .
Yes , after my graduation , I worked in a trade company in Macao for one year .
The export Business Section .
Yes , very much .
Where to , ma'am ?
The Grand Hotel ?
No , Madam . I don't think I do .
Would you like to order now ?
What would you like for your main course ?
Do you have something to read ?
Could you lend me one ?
Thanks . It's rather cold this morning , wouldn't you say ?
Do you know the news ?
Brazil wins the World Cup .
We have the orientation this afternoon .
The company introduction , our mission , vision , various policies , insurances , pension plan , company ID , batch , telephone , e-mail set-up and training .
Yes , it is not easy .
Excuse me , could you please show me the way to the human resource department ?
Yes , of course . I am Monica . I have made an appointment with your HR manager .
Thank you very much .
When can you get the finished product to me ?
Great ! That ’ ll be ahead of schedule ! Good work .
Have you got any cheaper ones ?
Good morning . what can I do for you ?
You've come to the right store . We've got a beautiful and wide selection of earrings for you to choose from .
Do you mean the exquisite pearl earrings ?
They're only three thousand yuan .
Well , it's specially made of a platinum alloy , sir , and the lustre will never fade out .
Room service .
Right . Excuse me . Mrs . Jones ?
What can I do for you ?
Just a few minutes , ma'am .
Hi , Sam . I want to buy a pet . Do you have any ideas ?
Why ? anything special there ?
Oh , really ? are there any snakes ?
That's terrific . I can't wait to check it out .
Why not ? it's so cool .
Pardon ?
Well , I didn't realize that .
Oh , I should have thought of my brother's baby girl . Maybe I'll just have a dog instead of an exotic pet .
Hello , this is room 1205 . Our message lamp is flashing .
Thank you .
Would you bring the message to my room .
Then I'll come down and pick up the message immediately .
guess what ? I've got great news !
well , you know how I've been working at the Economist as a proof-reader , right ?
well , the editor-in-chief heard that I had experience as an editor at another magadize and asked me if I was interested in becoming an assistant editor for him .
she said that the columnist for the literary criticism column would be going on pregnancy leave soon and that I could be in charge of the column until she came back .
it's a monthly magazine , but my column will be shared with another columnist so my articles will be due fortnightly .
yes , but I'm even more excited about getting my thoughts published again !
I don't have any with me , but I think I could manage to bring a free copy home for you .
me , too . Do you want to go out to celebrate my good news ?
have you seen the new Cosmo magazine that I was reading this morning ?
you're right , thanks . There's an interesting interview with a top director about his latest film that I want to finish .
it's Martin Scorsese . You liked his film , The Departed , didn't you ?
sure . You know it has an online edition , too . You should go online to read if you want to read it now .
no . I don't buy it regularly enough for it to be worthwhile .
it's almost three pounds now , and I think they're going to put the price up to four pounds soon .
Cosmo mainly has a middle-class readership , but I think circulation will fall dramatically if the price goes up anymore .
Wei ! This is a first-you didn't bargain !
But you could have saved money .
F . Y . I . , there is a flea market nearby , but maybe you're done ...
Can you help me do an internet search ?
I want to find information on the American Civil War .
Yes , I want to know about the battle of Gettysburg .
Oh wow , there are a lot of sites .
Thanks .
I just have to come up for air . I ’ Ve been here for too long a time .
Good afternoon . I'd like to speak with Tom Smith .
Do you know when he will be back ?
Is there some way I can get into contact with him ?
Thanks . And could I have his e-mail , just in case I can't get him by phone ?
Thank you so much . Does he read his e-mails daily ?
Great . Thanks again . You've been very helpful .
What seems to be the trouble , Mr . Brown ?
Oh , in what way ?
Did you lose any weight ?
When was the last time you had a check-up ?
Let me take your blood pressure . You look anemic .
You're just a little run-down from overwork .
I think all you need is just a vacation .
Good morning , Angela , how have you been lately ?
Well , rest assured that you can count on us to be here for the long run , sitdown.Coffee ?
Haha , I could never do that . I ’ d be a zombie if I didn ’ t have my morning coffee fix . Let ’ s get down to business then .
That ’ s great ! I ’ m glad to hear that Pear has finally jumped on the bandwagon . Right now our contract is for the five megapixel cameras . Is Pear still interested in having those ?
Can I get my dress today ?
Yes . Is that available now ?
Did you hear about the robbery ?
Are you serious ?
What happened ?
That's insane .
Then what happened ?
Did the cops show up in time ?
hello ! What are you reading about in the newspaper ?
people are starting to get frightened by it . Everyone will be relieved when they finally catch the murder .
there must have been some good news in the newspaper . I can ’ t believe that none of the news stories make you happy or excited .
yes . Her parents were raising money to have her treated in the united states .
I ’ m so happy for the family ! They must be very relieved and excited about that .
How much is it all together ?
Is it possible for you to reduce the price ?
This is the Bell Captain's Desk . May I help you ?
I'm very sorry to hear that . May I have your name and room number , please ?
And how many pieces did you have ?
Is there a name tag attached to them ?
Are you finished ?
Oh , sure . I'll be back in a minute.Thank you for waiting . Here it is.Did you enjoy your meal ?
Is that so ? I'm glad you enjoyed it .
Toilets are in the rear . I'm afraid all the toilets are fully occupied at the moment .
You look fresh recently.How do you make it ?
Aren't you tired ?
Hello , this is Liu Juan speaking . Is that Mr . Brown ?
Could you please get him on the phone ?
It's especially cold when the wind is blowing .
What can wearing one do for me ?

We have been over this a hundred times ! We are not getting a pet !
Who is going to look after a dog or a cat ?
What if we want to take a vacation ? Who will we leave it with ? Plus , our apartment is too small for that breed of dog .

You know , now that I think about it , I really don't have much more to say to you at all !
Have you declared your income and are you prepared to pay tax ?
I don't really know . Why not ask the accountant or the lawyer of the law firm ? They will tell you which is subject or not subject to taxation . He can even help you avoid paying tax legally .

Calm down ! Shouting won ’ t help ?
What happened ?
What ? He can't do this to you .
What did you do ?
Hold it , Mike . You won't accomplish anything by hollering at him , right ? You worked it all up till now . Why not wait until you cool down a bit ?
Just stay cool . You know . When you get back home tonight , tell him that you didn't mean to quarrel with him .
I know . It wouldn't hurt much to say sorry first . And after that , you can casually mention the problem . I am sure he will cooperate .
Excuse me . I am looking for a book called Little Women , but I can't find it anywhere .
Will you have it later ?
Who do you think is the greatest novelist in the history of English literature ?

I'm afraid he's not in at the moment Dave . He went out about an hour ago and he's not back yet .

How does the bank bill its customers for credit card charges ?

How do you want to spend your old age ?
Could you do me a favor and proofread my resume before I send it out to the human resources department ?
But languages don't have anything to do with engineering . Shouldn't everything I put on my resume have something to do with my field ?
It's just a piece of paper , you think that they can tell if I am a well-rounded person by looking at it ?
Why not come over to work in my company ?
Tell me what you need .

Yes , you can have a bird's-eye view of the whole city .

Yes , if we're lucky we'll find something in the next few days . I think you had a good idea to start flat hunting early .
I have a terrible toothache .

Can you fill it ?
Then I might as well have it done now .
May I have a look at that vase , please ?
Oh , it's really nice , but to tell the truth , that's far too expensive .

An excellent idea . Work now and play later .
Yes , madam ? Can I help you ?
Well , yes , we are , madam . The shop shuts down in five minutes .
Last week , madam ? I really can't remember which ones you mean . What were they like ?
That's strange . I don't recognize any of the ones we had from that description . Are you sure they were in this shop ?
I am afraid the sales are over now , madam . And you know we all sold out of the saucepans .
Well , it's all new stock in the window now .
Eh , well , madam , as you know we are closing .
Perhaps madam , if you come back tomorrow , I could show you the whole range of kitchen ware . And there are still one or two things at the sale price .
That might be the artificial lighting , madam . Of course , if you could come back in daylight , you might find it ’ s exactly what you are looking for .
I've come to hear about your offer .
I can tell you right now that your prices are a little higher than we expected .
I am afraid I can't agree with you there . I must point out your prices are higher than the quotations we've received from other companies .
I agree that yours are of the top .

Mmm , well this is our I ’ m sorry I cheated on you package . Two dozen red roses lined with tulips , carnations and lilies . The fragrance and beauty of this flower arrangement is sure to make her forgive you .
I ’ m sorry sir but , what exactly did you do ?
I have to get to Chicago by tomorrow and you're telling me that there are no flights ?
You mean like a bus ? Have you ever traveled for ten hours on a bus before ?
Alright , give me the number . But put me on that waiting list as well .
How many people are on the waiting list right now ?
How do you think they could be ended ?
So , if the cause is poverty , there should be a program to make the country richer.If the problem is resources , share them .
You still have not given me those files I ’ Ve asked you for .
I really don ’ t want to hear your excuses , Janet . We ’ re running a busy office here . You ’ re going to have to keep up .
What sort of job would you like to take ?
We need an operator now .
I wish the politicians would quit digging up dirt about each other's past .
And it takes up all the news .
It's so small . The fact that there is public interest , doesn't say much for us as the public .
I don't remember the last time I listened to AM radio .
Hello , Miss Wu , This is Dan Robson calling from OTC limited . I'd like to check my last order . When exactly was it sent out ?
Sure . No problem .
Sure . Do you have my number ?
What are you typing there ?
Really ? Did you find any information about a new job ?
Great ! Do you think you have a chance at getting the job ?
Maybe I should try looking on the web for work .
But there must be so many people who also see the advertisement for that job on the net . You might have no chance .
Would you please show me the necklace in the window ?
No , the one next to it .
Thanks . What kind of stone is this ?
Yes , please . How much is it ?
Happy birthday , Jim !
Here is a present for you . I hope you like it .
I'm very glad to hear that .
What's wrong with you ? You look pale .
When did the trouble start ?
It sounds like you are coming down with the flu . Let me take your temperature .
Yes , thirty-eight point seven . Do you have a headache , chest or throat pain ?
Now , let me have a look at you . I'd like to listen to your chest . Now breathe in , a deep breath , that's it Cough , now again . I want to examine your throat , too . Open wide , say ' Ah - - '
Yes , it does look a bit sore . Let's take an X-ray of your chest and give you a few tests .
The tests showed nothing wrong . A slight viral infection .
I have to check out today . I'd like my bill ready by 10 this morning .
I called HP about my computer .
They said I need a new hard drive .
It's not too much , only about $ 85 .
No , my hard drive is easy to remove and replace .
Yes , it's just a couple of screws .
It's a lot better than paying someone $ 60 .
Gosh , it's 7:30 , I'll miss the first class .
Is there anything wrong ?
Don ’ t worry . That ’ s just a part of being a teenager .
You should encourage her to make up her mind by herself . You shouldn ’ t affect her decision .
Oh , she can make her own decisions .
Believe me . Everything will be ok .
It's beautiful here .
How long will we dock ?
that was a really good meal , Gordon .
well , it is getting pretty late . I think we should go home .
let's see how much the bill is .
what are you talking about ? We'll split the bill .
no way , Gordon . I know that you are a little short on cash at the moment . There's no need for you to pay for the whole bill .
that's better . This way we will both have money to take a cab home , otherwise , you would probably have to walk .
you've got a deal .
I hear you are planning to travel abroad .
In my opinion , there are several places you mustn't miss , like Washington D . C , Las Vegas , New York and Los Angeles .
Yes , you may consider those two places also . Seattle , for example , is worth visiting and there's a very famous museum called Museum of Flight .
This looks like a very nice house .
The style of the exterior is just what I ’ Ve been looking for !
This home is gorgeous on the inside !
The wall colors totally suit the style of this house .
I love the bamboo flooring and granite countertops .
There is plenty of room for our king-sized bed , and I love the light in this room .
Room service.What can I do for you ?
Sorry sir , we will bring you one.Anything else ?
Good afternoon.British Airline.Is there any thing I can do for you ?
Sure . When do you want to take the plane ?
Will that be first class or economy seat ?
$ 200 .
Hello , Sir . So , you are back ?
That's pretty easy to explain . With the Deposit , the interest is fixed , but the Dividend of each policy will be transferred automatically into your bank account by the end of each year . The longer the term , the higher the Dividend you earn . This is because it is calculated at the Compound Interest Rate .
Are there any beds vacant ?
I prefer one facing the sea . Besides , it should have a shower .
Welcome to the company . We are conducting a survey of new employees to find out what influenced them to choose our company .
You're kidding ! Something as simple as that ?
Yes , there has been a lot of research into RSI's . Something so simple as proper chair height can prevent injuries . Tell me , did anything else influence your decision ?
Good afternoon . I've brought the extra blanket you asked for .
Is there anything I can do for you now ?
Lin's office supplies . How may I direct your call ?
Sure , just a moment . ... I'm sorry no one answer the phone .
Certainly !
Excuse me . Where is the way out ?
It's very confusing in here , isn't it ?
It should be the way out .
Excuse me , I ordered the well-done steak , but this one is so tough .
I think you should be more careful next time .
Allan , I am really disappointed by your lack of effort on this project .
No , I ’ m sorry . I disagree . I don ’ t think you ’ Ve been working at full speed at all .
Hi Joe , how are you doing today ?
Things are going well for me , Joe .
My parents are taking me to dinner tonight .
What movie did you want to see ?
I was thinking that I would like to see “ The Secret Life of Bees . ”
How's the bride-to-be ?
Just relax . With me as your maid of honor , everything will be fine !
Hey ! I'm the tour guide . I'll take care of the Taiwanese guests .
Jim ? Jim ? ... What are you doing in the kitchen ?
Milk ? I thought you didn't like milk .
Nonsense . There's lots of food in the refrigerator ... What's behind your back ?
What are you hiding behind your back ? Let me see .
OK , I promise . What is it ?
Oh , Jim . I told you . No pets . It'll make a mess of this house .
No way . It might belong to somebody else . You can't keep it here .
All right . But you have to clean up everything it messes up .
I was wondering if you could help me with something .
Actually , it ’ s a little bit silly .
What words do I need to know to buy a pair of shoes ?
Don ’ t worry about that . I can point it out in the store .
Excuse me . How long has it been since the business was founded ?
So , it has a history for more than a decade ?
What can I do for you , Madam ?
Certainly , Madam . What would you like to know ?
Let's do something outdoors today .
Okay . what do you want to do ?
Good afternoon . I come here specially to pick up my tickets . I booked it last month.This is my reservation note .
The last thing to be ignored at a Chinese dinner table is to keep modest .
No , absolutely not ! On the contrary , you'll be considered a well-connected , sociable man , if you keep involved in the conversation all the time . But always pay attention to what you say . If the table has a senior guest , say something as upbeat and cheerful as possible . Or maybe , you may give the floor to him and keep listening as if very interested .
Correct . Show respect for the older people . Conventionally , before the meal starts , the younger members are supposed to address each one of the elderly members of the table one by one . Others are kept in waiting until the most venerable guest proclaim the beginning of the meal and takes the first bite . Toasts also go to these men first before people can toast to each other .
Yes , plenty of them . Don't eat fast ! People usually keep their dining pace accorded with others . And all the dishes should not be eaten up completely .
Our toner cartridges are already out of ink ... Could you make an order for a new set ?
You can double check with the housekeeping department , but I am pretty sure all of the machines will need new cartridges . Last time when we made our order to the supplier , the quantity was also especially high . They are used to receiving such bulk orders from us . As long as we give them a heads up a couple days in advance , they can usually fill the order .
I think the only thing is toner . Try to see if they can deliver it before the end of business day tomorrow . We should really try to do better about waiting until the last minute to fill orders that are usually made on a monthly basis . Anyhow , see what you can do to expedite the order this time .
I want a pair of sports shoes , Adidas .
I wear size 40 .
May I help you ?
What size do you wear ? These shoes are on sale .
Of course , yes.They look nice.And they're not expensive .
They are $ 168 .
A friend of mine has been taking an online career planning course these days . He told me the other day he has learned a lot from it . He recommended me to subscribe to it . What do you say ?
Well , just something in general , like several key steps in planning career and how to set specific and tenable goals .
Making a decision to start over is not an easy thing to do . It seems that you need this course more than I do . I love my current job . If I take this course , I hope to learn some tricks to get myself more organized at work . If they can give suggestions about how to boost work relationships , that will be great . I need these to improve my current work performance .
Who's it knocking at the door ?
Good evening . Welcome to Cherry's . Do you have a reservation ?
How many of you , please ?
Hi , I think I was supposed to call for my test results today .
Are you saying that there weren ’ t any problems ?
Will I be able to read the results on the website and understand them ?
How will I know what the numbers mean ?
How can I see test results from tests I have taken before ?
This is our rock-bottom price , Mr . Lee .
What I mean is that we'll never be able to come down to your price . The gap is too great .
What's your proposal ?
Do you mean a further reduction of 50 dollars in our price ? That's impossible !
The best we can do is another 30 dollars off . That's definitely the lowest we can go .
Hello .
No , I was just about to get up . What's up , Carl ?
B as in boy . You should get off at the last stop in Chinatown .
That's the wrong direction . Canal Street is on the other side of Chinatown .
At 10,45 . Is Ann coming along ?
See you around , Carl .
Has your company been affected much by government legislation ?
What about your use of raw materials ?
What happens if you exceed the limits ?
Have you got any better ?
Okay , I'll take one .
Good morning , sir . Sorry to disturb you . May I make up the room now ?
What are the factors that have great impact on the perspective of this corporation ?
What are the internal factors that influence the company ?
I don ’ t want you to be worried , but our son has some bad habits now . He says painful words everyday .
He says kick mommy , beat mommy , don ’ t want mommy , very quickly if I do something that he doesn ’ t like . You know , if I wash his face or change his clothes , things like that .
Yes , but sometimes he is just not reasonable .
It ’ s easy to say , but I will try .
How can I help you ?
Do you have an appointment ?
I wonder if Mr . Smith forgot your meeting . I am afraid he left this office this morning and is not expected back until after 4 pm . Let me find out if he made arrangements for someone else to meet with you in his place . Will you please have a seat ?
Yes , Mr . Mason , I just checked with our office manager , Ms . Terry , she said Mr . Smith briefed her on your project . She is just finishing up a meeting now . She could be with your shortly . Would you like me to show you around while you are waiting ?
did you watch the Oscars on Sunday night ?
yes , that was surprising . I heard that they got into a fight and then decided not to go .
they're also one of the richest couples . They have so many money and they can buy almost anything they want .
did either one of them win an Oscar this year ?
Tom Cruise may be handsome , but I think he's a bit crazy , don't you ?
I still think that they only got married to get more publicity for their movies and themselves .
I would never want to be a celebrity because the paparazzi would also be after you .
thank goodness we're not rich and famous !
Next , please .
Yes , the rate for cash purchases is listed on the electronica screen , so you have seen the rate of exchange .
How much do you like to exchange ?
In what denominations ?
Right , I will exchange for you now . Please sign the exchange form giving the name and telephone .
OK , wait for a moment . Well , I am sorry , but we are not authorized to exchange coins because it is low and we do not have enough foreign coins . In this case , you'd better change 2,000 $ to Swiss francs .
Please sign the memo on the bottom and keep your money and memo .
Why are you holding me in this jail cell ?
I have to go up to London for a couple of days next week . Would you like to come ?
Well , I prefer to go on the train , but I suppose you want me to take the car .
And I've got to drive . You know I'm not fond of that . I found it much more relaxing to sit in the train .
But very much quicker . But I know we'll never agree on this subject . You prefer the car . I prefer the train .
I want to take a look at that home with the Open House flags out front .
Yes , that is one of the houses that we have on our list .
I am going to go sign my name in the registry to let the listing agent know that we were here .
I really appreciate that the listing agent provided water on such a hot day .
Is the current asking price listed on the flyer ?
Hello . This is Mrs . Wilson . I'd like to buy a new car . Could you offer me a new type of the car , please ?
A new car . And I've got a small family , two children , and I haven't got a lot of money and ...
Isn't this the car store ?
Oh , sorry . Do you know the number for a car store , then ?
I'm sorry to have bothered you .
How about going to the cinema tonight ?
I am not sure about the name of the film , but I know it's a romantic one .
Don't you think it's too bloody ?
Hello , I scheduled an appointment with Dr . Smith , and I can ’ t make it on that day .
My appointment was on Monday .
It was for 10
I would prefer next Thursday .
I want to come in at 2
Office Supplies , Inc . Robert speaking , may I help you ?
Yes , Ms . Reese . I remember , you spoke with me . Is there a problem ?
Ms Anderson , my name is Mike . I am Division Chief of ABC Company . Welcome to Toronto .
A pleasure meeting you as well , the flowers are for you .
I am really interested in buying this television .
How much are you selling it for ?
You can't be serious .
That's too expensive for me .
You can't go down on the price .
I'll buy it for $ 2000 .
Did you pack this bag yourself ? Has it been out of your possession at any time before checking-in ?
Are you bringing in any plants or animal products ?
Our sniffer dog seems to disagree . Do you mind if we look in your suitcase ?
What ’ s this sir ?
What are these red things sir ?
Hello.Is Bob there , please ?
Oh.This is Paul.When will he be back ?
Can I leave a message please ?
Please tell him I'll call him at the office tomorrow afternoon .
Hey , son , are you insured ?
I took out a life insurance policy and made your mother the beneficiary .
I am a fireman and it is a dangerous job . I have to consider your mother's life .
You have children now . What if something , God forbid , happens to you ?
Excuse me , Mr . Emory ? Mr . Macmillan , would like to know if you have the completed schedule for next week ?
Thank you , sir . Sorry to trouble you .
Where are you going , Jane ?
I saw her yesterday.She was a little better .
No , you needn't . A number 13 bus will also take you to the hospital .
Yes . I caught a number 7 bus yesterday , and they said I had taken a wrong bus .
Good morning , Passport , please .
Ah , thank you.Please bring your luggage here for inspection .
It's just a regular inspection . Do you have anything to declare ?
Well , the cigarettes and the champagne are not in excess of the duty-free allowance . But according to our law , each passenger is allowed only one camera duty-free.You ' ll have to pay duty for the other one .
Please wait a minute . I'll make out the duty memo ... Here you are.Take this and pay to the woman over there .
Very well . I hope you ' ll enjoy your stay in America .
Hello , Nancy , nice to see you .
Yes , I ’ m satisfied with this job .
Pay more attention to the external expressions , because they are important for the first impression . Good manner and style of conversation can let other feel your good self-cultivation . Good gestures and mien can let other feel very comfortable .
Stupid girl , making me spend so much money , now I have to get it from the ATM ...
I know where to put my card ! Stupid machine , talking to me like I ’ m an idiot ...
Yeah , yeah , I know what I selected . Just gimme my money !
No , no ! Stupid machine , what are you doing ! No !
No , no way ! What happened ? Give me my money !
Joe , how are you doing ?
I am doing great ! Thank you for asking , Joe .
I need to stay home tonight and finish my term paper .
What were you planning on seeing ?
How about “ The Secret Life of Bees ” ?
What do you think we need to do to get our new branch office running well ?
That ’ s very important . A friend recommended a good law firm to me . We ’ ll need someone to hire staff .
Yes . We have . We chose the location in the northeast of the city , not too far from the airport and on the edge of the CBD .
The offices there were too expensive . Have we negotiated any contracts yet ?
When will the branch office open ?
Has and advertising campaign been prepared ?
Good afternoon . what can I do for you ?
May I have your key please ?
Here is your valuable . Is that right ?
did you know that abortion is still illegal in many states in the USA ?
well , for many religious people , they believe that people who abort their babies are murderers .
no , I think it's mostly the older generation who are against abortions .
religious people blame it on pre-marital sex , not on abortion being illegal .
I personally would never want to have one , but I think that since a pregnancy can affect a woman's entire life , she should have the right to decide for herself .
I know this is going to sound sexist , but I don't think that men should have to give their approval to the mothers of their children .
that may be true , but when a woman gets pregnant , it changes her life completely . Men can still carry on with their lives after the birth exactly as they did beforehand .
Come to think of it , you should get out your English books and catch up on your reading assignments .
Then review for your test . You'll do even better . And maybe reading will help you get to sleep .
I'm just calling to see if you have made any decision about the position .
Do you have any idea when you might arrive at a decision ?
How did you find your apartment ?
What if I need a roommate ?
How much do apartments cost around here ?
I just need a one-bedroom apartment .
Would you come with me to look at apartments ?
Have you heard what happened ?
Deborah already had her baby .
I thought you knew .
The baby was 8 pounds 6 ounces .
Will you go and visit them ?
I just wanted to give you the good news .
How silly of you to jump out of the window !
Why not use staircases ? The terror was not so violent at that time .
Maybe the situation is too urgent .
I need to stop eating such unhealthy foods .
What foods do you eat now ?
Those are the only things you eat ?
Why aren't you eating anything else ?
And the chicken ?
Good morning ! I am a new comer in our office .
Nice to meet you ! My name is Grace Williams .
Today is my first day at work !
Thank you . It's very kind of you .
Do you have experience in advertising ?
What were you mean duties there ?
What qualities do you think an advertising planner should have ?
What was the most important thing you have learned at work ?
The air conditioning is not working ! We need to call a handyman before we start to fry in here !
That would be convenient . They might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . The circuit breakers keep going out all the time . It ’ s really annoying !
Do you have anything to do after this ?
Shall we drop in somewhere for a couple of drinks ?
I know a very interesting place .
Oh , hi , Jessica , are you going to see this movie too ?
Then let's go in .
I'll say the movie's starting in the minute .
Looks like he won't show up . He's done this before , hasn't he ?
What's he trying to pull anyway .
Maybe you should start seeing someone else .
I can't believe how hot it is .
That means it will get hotter .
Turn on the air conditioner .
What happened ?
Did you call the repairman ?
When is he coming ?
Please help yourself to whatever you like , don't be shy .
This dish taste terrific . Would you like to try a little ? It is a little hot , but very good .
Would you like another beer ?
Come on , it's the weekend . Let's taste and enjoy this meal . Cheers !
I have a complaint to make . The bill you sent me was incorrect . What's more , it isn't the first time
Don't you think it's about time you got them working properly ?
What's the weather forecast for today ?
Any rain ?
Oh , Linda , you must be so excited about going to study in America .
Well , I'm sure you will .
What's the matter
What are the most popular sports in your country ?
Jogging and bowling . Do you know how to practise Bungfu ?
Is it easy to learn ?
Thank you . I can teach you how to bowl .
When was America discovered , Tony ?
America was discovered by Christopher Columbus in 1492 .
All right . Ask me a question now .
That's easy . It was invented by Edison .
I can't answer that . But I think Mars will be visited by men before theed of this century .
All right . What is the nearest planet to the sun ?
Check out these wheels !
No , I borrowed it .
You guessed right . Besides , the color violet is a little girly for me .
We quarreled yesterday , and he picked up and left .
I am not sure .
Whew ! I had to wait for almost an hour to get to the front of the line .
Wow ! Your calligraphy is very beautiful . It was worth the wait !
What does it say ?
That's very nice . Is it for sale ?
Really ? Then what do you do with it ?
Wow ! Really ? Are you sure ? Now I'll have a lucky year !
I often recalled the days when Tom and I were madly in love .
Yeah . He always tickled my finny bone with his college stories .
It seldom rains this summer .
Because of pollution and other things , our environment has become worse and worse .
I'm looking forward to summer vacation .
My granny is such a kind-hearted person . She is willing to help .
Look at this newspaper article about this famous local medium . It says that she is really gifted and so popular now , that she is booked solid with appointments for the next twelve months !
Well , I have had many friends that went to a psychic and got their palms read and most of the things the psychic told her came true !
Well , historically it is a practice that many cultures share . Reading the tarot cards , in the east they would even read tea leaves ! I even heard that there are people that make you smoke a cigar , and then read your ashes .
Can I help you , sir ?
Would you tell me the name of the book and the author ?
I'm sorry . It's out of stock now . Could you come by again next week ?
Well , then , is it convenient to leave your phone number so that I can inform you as soon as we restock it ?
Bob !
Fine , just fine.And you ?
I am so glad I caught you at home . I need your help !
Cafe au lait , cafe latte , cappuccino , cafe mocha ... I can't keep them all straight !
Hello , is this the ABC company ?
We have just arrived from Tokyo only ... looking for a reserve car of your company . All of above , we cannot find it .
Our reservation number is J - 221 .
You mean you haven ’ t arranged any car ?
What kind of gas does this car take ?
I will give you premium unleaded . Alright ?
That is the pump you are in front of .
It is the most expensive .
Yes , I can give you regular unleaded . But you have to back up the car a little .
I'm sorry , sir . This is not a full service gas station . I will help you fill the gas , but we don't wash windows here .
Mary , it's good to see you !
I am so glad that you decided to stop by !
Mary , can I get Josh or you something to drink ?
How about a little snack then ?
Well then , how is your family ?
Everything is now . I'm kind of sick of it .
Oooh ! One for each of the zeros in 2000 ! Wow !
So find a guy to marry and you can get one !
I went to the tutoring service centre on campus today . And I got a job .
They got me a part-time tutoring job , teaching an Australian businessman Chinese .
It's very simple actually . You can go to the service centre and have your name and job interest resisted . They will give you a call if any job comes up .
Has Robert ever missed coming to one of our parties ?
Do you know why ?
Wow ! What a beautiful scenic spot ! It's so open . And just breathe that fresh air , you can almost taste its freshness .
Wonderful ! I'll often come here for mountain climbing .
No wonder people say
I didn't know you liked bird-watching .
Hide me , Yi-jun ! The kids all think I'm the real Easter bunny !
It's a success all right . The kids keep trying to catch me .
Some game ! You try being tackled by ten kids at once !
hi , Bob , I am so glad that you came .
yeah . It's hard to believe that it's been ten years since graduation . It feels just yesterday we collected our diplomas .
oh , where to start ? There have been ups and downs . I'm still trying to find my place in this world . It's only recently that I've been able to start settling down . How about you ? You still with Jenn
oh , that sounds wonderful . I have always known you two would make it . I hope I can keep in better contact with you guys . I don't want us to drift apart again .
I guess I'm just a little nervous . I'm giving everything I have to invoking , and ...
Exactly .
How ?
Are you ready for the camping trip ?
Hello ! We're supposed to be getting back to nature .
I've been packed for a week . All my stuff is in this backpack .
That's trail mix !
It's getting late . I really have to go .
I hope so . A good journey to you !
I ’ m fed up with marriage .
Oh , no . When we were poor , we often tried our best to make ends meet . It was a hard time .
And we have some squabbles on some boring things .
How about you and Tom ? What time is your wedding ?
What ’ s the matter ? So angry . I ’ m just playing a joke with you .
Margaret , do you think I should enroll in the science course ?
Right , I figure since you are doing premedical , you know about the very courses .
Yes , I really weak in maps , I did poorly in high school .
What are you listening to ? Is that Beethoven or Mozart ?
I think Beethoven's music is incredible . I've heard that listening to it can make you more intelligent , too . Do you believe that ?
What other kind of music do you listen to ?
To be honest , I think classical music is too complicated for me .
I like pop music . Do you ?
I see what you mean . I think that's way I like it so much .
I've always been into it . Have you always liked classical music ?
So , how did you become interested in it ?
Do you still play piano ?
Hi Paul . How are you , friend .
How so ?
Have you talk to him about it ?
Ahahah , Maybe that will help you lose weight .
Sorry Paul . I couldn't help it . So why doesn't he give you a hand ?
You're from New York , aren't you ?
What do you suggest I should see in New York ?
No , I don't like museums . They're boring .
What's your favorite book ?
Why do you like it best ?
Well . I like the Thom Birds best .
Sure . I like the writer's language , too .
Would you like to go to the bookshop with me ?
John , my father isn't there at all . Are you kidding ?
It's ... oh it's the 1st April , April Fool's Day .
I ’ m pretty sure that Jim will turn out to be a good lawyer .
Could you tell me if you have ever taken a class from Dr . Miller ?
Yes , but I have never taken his class before .
Yes , that's what I need .
Yes , I guess so .
Yes , I had a teacher like that before .
No , I didn't , but that could be a good thing .
Honey , what's wrong with you ?
Take it easy . We are going to have our own baby . You should be happy .
The doctors and the nurses will help you . And I will be waiting for you right here , praying for you and our baby .
The weather is terrible .
I have been watching a lot of videos at home because of the constant rain .
I saw the weather report , and it's going to rain for the next eight days .
I'm getting pretty bored . We should do something despite the rain .
I haven't been to the Mall in a long time . Let's go there .
Great . I'll stop by your place now .
Come in , come in , what can I do for you ?
Yes , I am applying on it .
Aren't you a bit young ? I have a lot of qualified seniors to take the course and they usually have a hard time keeping up .
Well , if you think you are ready , I'll let you enroll .
... so , I said , let ’ s take a break.And since that night , I ’ Ve been waiting for him to call , but I still haven ’ t heard from him . You don ’ t think he ’ s seeing someone else , do you ?
You think so ? Oh , no ! How can he do this to me ? I ’ m sure he ’ s cheating on me ! Why else wouldn ’ t he call ?
He ’ s the love of my life ! I ’ Ve really messed this up .
But I ... I still love him ! And it ’ s all my fault ! I can ’ t believe how immature and selfish I was being . I mean , he is a firefighter , it ’ s not like he can just leave someone in a burning building and meet me for dinner . I ’ Ve totally messed this up !
No , this is not gonna happen ! I ... I ’ Ve ruined everything ...
what's wrong , Jerry ? You look so upset .
oh , I'm sorry to hear that . You can go on a holiday to cheer you up .
come on . A trip will do you good . Are you doing anything this weekend ?
well , my friends and I are planning on going to Shangri-La on Saturday . Do you want to come with us ?
not very far from here . We'll fly . It's about one and a half hours .
there is a large canyon , vast grasslands , ancient forests and mountain lakes .
yes , the scenery there is breathtaking . I have some pictures at home . You can come over and take a look if you like .
Did you have any kind of punishment in your life and studies ?
What was the reason ?
Do you want to hang out tomorrow ?
Really ? Wow with who ?
Wait a minute , you mean you met her online ?
That is kind of weird ! What if she is a psycho or something like that ?
Well , I'm afraid I must be going now . I have no idea it was so late .
I'm afraid I can't . I have a dinner party at seven tonight . You see , I am going to England the day after tomorrow .
It has been a pleasure . Goodbye .
Honey , do you have a second ?
We need to talk .
I ’ Ve been thinking , and well , I think we need to start seeing other people .
That ’ s just it , I ’ m not happy anymore , Tim . It ’ s not you , it ’ s me . I know that I can be hard to deal with , and you are a great guy ! You are the type of guy that any woman would kill for !
Tim , you are too good for me . You deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy . Oh , I could say that I ’ ll be all you need , but that would be a lie . I know I ’ d only hurt you , I know I ’ d only make you cry .
I can ’ t , Tim . I hope someday you can find some way to understand I ’ m only doing this for you . I don ’ t really wanna go but , deep in my heart I know this is the kindest thing to do .
Oh , my God . I can't take it any more .
I am tired of doing that boring work . I just repeat doing counting everyday . It's so terrible .
You know I work with my professional knowledge not passion . Sometimes I don't know what the meaning of working is ?
Yes , that's in the past . Maybe I need to go to my psychologist for help .
I was full of ambitions before . But now I have no aim for my career .
That sounds interesting . But I don't know how to do that .
A training course ? That must be costly .
OK , let's have a try .
Have you seen the new James Bond movie ?
Yes . What did you think of it ?
Yes , I liked it , too . It was exciting , but not over the top . Do you know what I mean ?
Oh , yes . He's brilliant . Did you like the title song ?
Hum , Edward Norton , or something like that . Did you like him ?
I don't know . I think the woman was better . She provided a good love interest . Lucky James Bond !
My friend Jean is very beautiful .
Perfect , and I like her charming eyes too .
Where are you going ?
Why not listen to music online ?
You can audition music on line , and you can audition it off line after downloading it , so you needn't pay for it .
In order to listen to music , you must have the necessary software .
Certainly . Realplayer is a good .
Yes , but you need install it after downloading so that you can use it .
What were you and Richard talking about earlier ? It looked intense .
Oh , no . I know how insensitive he can be . What has he done now ?
But , you were born and raised in California !
What a racist ! How can you stand working with the guy ?
So , what did you say when he asked you how long it took you to learn English ?
Are you sure he really got the message ?
That's hilarious ! What did he say ?
Could you tell me the origin of the Dragon-Boat Festival ?
I see.Did they succeed in the end ?
What can I do for you today ?
Do you have your library card ?
There is a wait for the computers .
You need to print your name on this list .
Once a computer is available , I will let you know .
All you do is type in the number on the back of your card .
how are you doing , Christopher ?
are you doing anything this weekend ?
are you available on Sunday ?
ok , well , my friends and I are planning on going to the beach on Sunday . We tend to leave around noon whenever we go anywhere , so you could still sleep in . Do you want to come with us ?
it's a quiet beach just about an hour outside of the city .
we've got plenty of inflatables , but if you want to sit on a chair , you'll have to bring your own sunlounger .
do you like surfing ?
we've got a few . I can teach you how to surf on Sunday . It'll be fun !
you'll just need roughly $ 10 for food and gas money . My friend is driving , so we usually all chip in a few dollars for gas money .
I'm not really accustomed to the style of the new boss .
I give up ! I simply can't learn French !
No , I'm not . I try and try and I still can't speak it very well .
He said I have a big nose . I wonder what that means .
Does he mean I am inquisitive or I ’ m noisy ?
Excuse me , I'd like to ask you a few questions about the city .
My wife wants to take the children to go shopping , where is the best place to go ?
Thank you . Also , we'd like to do some sightseeing while we're in town . Can you recommend some local attractions ?
I have a 10 - year-old boy and a 6 - year-old girl .
Boy , it looks like everyone in your family is here , from young to old .
And after church they come here for lunch ?
Yeah , what's up with that ?
Hi ! I'm happy you could make it .
What can I get you ?
Could you please help me to check out the book ?
I can't remember that clearly . It probably be Charles ...
No , no , no . I'm not interested in literature .
Oh , sorry . I'm always absent-minded . I remember that I've put a note in my pocket .
I can't find it now .
Let me see . It's not fiction . It's biography .
How do you decide what grade we get ?
What is the most important factor ?
How can we keep track of our grades ?
What if we can't get to school ?
If we have a major problem , will you let us know ?
We're thinking about going to America .
There is that .
May I help you with something ?
I ’ ll take them .
These books were due two weeks ago .
You will need to pay late fees on these books .
The fee is 25 cents every day .
And that ’ s for each book that is late .
This is such a beautiful day ! Great for sailing !
Why are you doggy-paddling ? I taught you how to swim ! Do your breast stroke !
Try kicking your legs more . That ’ s good . Don ’ t go out too far !
Kathy ! Get back here ! I see a shark !
what was your wedding ceremony like , Abigail ?
three parties ? That's quite a lot . That must have been expensive !
were your parents upset that they weren't there to see you get married ?
did your husband's family get to meet your family ?
that makes sense . Did you go on a honeymoon ?
you really didn't have a very traditional wedding , did you ?
Oh , hi , Jessica , are you going to see this movie too ?
Then let's go in .
I'll say the movie's starting in the minute .
Looks like he won't show up . He's done this before , hasn't he ?
What's he trying to pull anyway .
Maybe you should start seeing someone else .
So , you ’ re applying for a B2 visa , where is your final destination and what ’ s the purpose of your trip to the United States ?
And how long do you you plan to remain in the United States ?
And , who is sponsoring your trip ?
Alright , tell me about the ties you have to your home country .
And what evidence do you have that you are financially independent ?

That depends . We offer membership for one month , half a year and one year .
Do you watch a lot of TV ?
Not me . I have to have my TV and watch whatever comes on .
Hi . What's your name ?
My name is Jessica . It's nice to meet you .
No . I'm a sophomore . I take it you are a new student ?
Have fun while it lasts . The excitement wears off real quick . Especially after you see how much homework you get . Where are you from ?
I have never been to Korea . I've been to Japan before , but never Korea .
My father thought it would be a good experience to take a vacation to a different country . He's so into learning about different cultures .
I thought it would have been more fun if I went without my parents .
Thanks for the offer . I'll keep that in mind . Oh , the professor is coming . We'll talk more after class .
Guess who I saw just now ?
John Smith , the escaped criminal .
I think I must report to the cops .
What do you think of this one ?
And this one ? Too flashy ?
Hug ! And this sweater from my aunt ? Isn ’ t it hideous ?
Are you even listening ? I ’ m trying to have a conversation with you .
Well I have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when I go to the Boxing Day sales this afternoon !
Oh , your precious game . You watch the same game every year , and each year your beloved hometown team loses by at least three goals !
Hello . Nice to see you again . I heard you went into hospital for a few days to undergo surgery . I hope everything ’ s OK .
I really dislike going to a doctor or to a hospital .
It must have really hurt afterwards .
I bet you were ready for a thick juicy steak when you got out of hospital .
Is there any pain now ?
Did they take good care of you in the hospital ?
How was the party ?
Hi , Monica , how is everything going ?
Why ? You ’ re not satisfied anymore ?
That is important . Doing research on a company you are interested in will definitely help your application .
Henry married Rose only after her father's money , didn't he ?
But he seems to be very happy with Rose .
Hello , is that Cathy speaking ?
Yes , how are you doing ?
Say I've got two tickets for the concert this evening.Would you like to come with me ?
Then I ' ll pick you up at six thirty.OK ?
The weather has been terrible this week .
Is that pesky lady coming to the office again ?
If there's one thing that bugs me , it's her critical attitude .
Hi , Mr . Smith . what's new ?
What's the matter ?
Go ahead . It's nothing serious . We are good friends , aren't we ?
How do you do ?
It ’ s nice to meet you , Mr . Stevens .
Thanks for your hospitality .
I'm terribly sorry to have caused you so much trouble .
Hey , what's new ?
Ok , wait a minute ... let's see . I'm a Taurus , and it says , Mars is in the third house , and is soon to eclipse Venus . I don't know what that means , but then it says , Your charm and drive will win others over to your way of thinking . Remember to be positive . Sounds good to me .
Since Mercury has crossed paths with Jupiter , your fortunes are falling . Bad luck will follow you today , and you will lose that which you value . Be careful .
Lily , can you take part in our picnic this weekend ?
I think we can go to the river , go around and have supper .
What do you think of doctor Thomson ?
How can you be so sure ?
Should we ask Jason to play ? He's always watching movies on HBO .
Oh , come on ! The game is better with three people . Anyway , if we don't ask him to play , he'll be mad .
What do you think about violence in movies ?
But kids like watching things like that . It's just for fun , would't you say ?
Are you free tomorrow night ?
Shall we have dinner together ?
Yes , I do . I know a place that has excellent food .
If only our company prescribe flex time .
Good news . Ah , what if be even better if alternative work place is provided .
Brian , do you know how to speak English ?
Where did you learn ?
You speak really well .
How long have you been in the U . S . ?
Is your wife with you ?
Have you been to California before ?
Have you ever been to Las Vegas ?
How are the children doing at sport ?
He ’ s not very good at the long jump though , is he ?
Two meters ? That means that the high jump bar is above his head ! Are any of them good at long-distance running ?
How are they at swimming ?
Kate is very good at diving from a height of 10 meters .
I think that these kinds haven ’ t learnt to be afraid yet . She started diving from a lower height , but she soon wanted to go higher .
Hi , Mary . I haven't seen you in ages ! I heard that you and Daniel are getting married on August 8th , the opening day of the 2008 Olympic Games . Is it true ?
Good for you ! It sounds like you've done a lot of planning in a very short time .
Is everything ready now ?
Have you tried The Peninsula Palace Beijing ? My wedding reception was held there and they did an excellent job .
It's an excellent hotel . A friend of mine had her wedding reception there and said it was perfect , though very expensive .
I guess you're right . I can help you ask other hotels . I am sure there are probably some available .
Why didn't you tell me you had a girlfriend ?
But you should have told me you were in love with her .
You know you didn't .
Yes , but you might have told me before .
You can't be serious.How dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
Professor , I've handed in my paper . Did you read it ?
How ’ s it going ?
Do you need anything ?
What can I do for you ?
Did you check the periodicals ?
I ’ ll show you where to find your article .
It ’ s right this way .
How about eating out for a drink with me tonight .
No problem . Let's say 6:30 p . m . at the Royal Restaurant , OK ?
Hi , Helen ! how is it going ?
Well , take it easy ! Don't let it get on top of you .
Why don't you take a few days off ?
Can you speak Japanese ?
Where did you learn it ?
How long have you been learning it ?
Can you speak any other languages ?
Good afternoon , Johnson .
I'm too tired now . I've already worked for 12 hours overtime !
Yes , they were supposed to , but so far nobody's turned up , and I have to do the work alone . This is the first break I've had all day .
I'm afraid I can't before I finish this project .
I will , thanks for your concern .
It is too bad today .
My som was lost . I told him to stand rooted to the spot when I went shopping , but he ignored it .
It was the police wo helped me to do that .
I want to give our kitchen the works .
No . The decoration has been out-of-date . My friends have a whole kitchen now . It ’ s modern .
Rock music really leaves me cold . What about you ?
Then tell me what's good about it .
What's wrong with Debbie today ? She seems upset about something .
Look , here is a very special business card from an illustrator . Every time I go through my book of business cards , I will notice it . It is an eye-catching one .
Yes , it is a bold design . People will believe he can make an illustration as an impressive as a business card . It just stands out from those plain and standard ones used by government people or other big private and public organizations .
Morning , Peter . Nice suit ! A new one ?
Maybe . Several people have suggested that I get more yellow clothes . They say the color suits me because I have a fair complexion .
Thank you for your compliments . It sounds like you're a clothing expert .
Did you set your clock forward for daylight savings time ?
Well , at the start of the spring we usually have more daylight in the mornings and less in the afternoon . This is basically due to our position on the planet and the rotation of the earth . In any case , to take better advantage of the daylight available , we compensate by moving our clocks forward one hour .
That just stands for Greenwich Mean Time . Here in California , we are in Pacific Standard Time , that is eight time zones west of Greenwich . Remember when we were in Beijing ? Well , then we were in China Standard Time , and that ’ s eight time zones east of Greenwich !
I would like to watch the Oscars on tv tonight . How about you ?
I like watching it for the fashion . I like to see what the ladies are wearing . Of course , the men nearly always just wear the traditional tuxedo .
I ‘ m really not sure . Usually just one or two films look set to sweep the awards ceremony , but this year there are several contenders .
You might think this strange , but I like the category for best foreign language film .
How many cleaning ladies does your company hire ?
Most cleaning ladies are illiterate . But some of them do a very nice job .
How do you celebrate national day in your country ?
What kinds of parades are there ?
We don ’ t have a national day .
I guess it is . Most countries have on , but we don ’ t .
Hi Melissa , are you going home this weekend ?
Where do your parents live ?
How about your mother ?
Oh , I am sorry to hear that . Is your father still working ?
Do you have any family here ?
Do you have any brothers or sisters ?
Do you see them a lot ?
Hey , how was the show ?
Really ? I heard it was supposed to be great .
What happened , John ?
Why do you look unhappy ?
Oh , cheer up . He ’ ll understand you .
You know that ? Joan has got the scholarship .
But I think Henry is a backroom boy.He always helps her with her study .
Hi , Tina , I ’ Ve got good news . I have successfully passed the first two rounds of interview with ABC Company . They informed me to go to the final round next Monday . It looks very promising .
Thanks . Let ’ s go for a celebration this evening . Are you free ?
No problem . See you !
Do you like ethnic food ?
Really ? Have you ever tried Moroccan ?
I don't know . A friend of mine said I should try it .
As a matter of fact , he gave me this address .
Nicole , your Fettucini is very ... unique .
Actually , it's better ...
No . It was the only dish she wasn't good at . So we could use you as the new head chef ...
How many people are there in your family ?
Is your brother older or younger than you ?
Hello , Tom . Where are you heading for ?
Another terror film ? There is too much terror and violence in the films . Do you like seeing such a picture ?
Did you go to the concert last weekend ?
Yes . I did . I enjoyed it a lot.There was a folk singer , a violinist and a pianist .
Mary and Tom are breaking up .
Mary said she couldn't put up with Tom , for he fell in love with another woman .
No , I don't think so . She said she would rather be single than cope with an unhappy marriage .
have you ever been invited to a Chinese feast ?
as far as you could see , is dining at a Chinese table a distinct experience ? To what extent does it differ from that in your homeland ?
but you look quite proficient in using them now .
yes , table etiquette . There are a multitude of rules that foreigners might never know until they were told . Some practices even appear somewhat awkward or rude to Westerners , while they are the norm i
maybe you should have placed them horizontally over your bowl or plate . They resemble two incense sticks used at sacrifices . It's very inauspicious , and might enrage all present .
It really makes my blood boil when this sort of thing happens . I even want to wring his neck .
I can't forget it .
Let's program your courses . Since you have had English literature , you should take American literature and American prose and fiction.You transcript indicate that your English background is strong , so I don't think you have any problem with it .
Three , you also should take two three-credit-course in education department .
I hate to go outside .
Why do you hate to go outside ?
I agree .
Rude people are everywhere .
You can yell at them .
Yelling doesn't do any good .
I had to announce his innocence in court today , but it left a nasty taste in my mouth .
I ’ m not sure . I ’ ll try to prove my feeling .
Actually I have a passion for Chinese literature .
Yeah , those classics from the great writers .
Jack wonders whether Linda likes him or not .
He is too scared to ask her .
Good morning .
What does the paper say ?
Well , what ’ s the weather report ?
Did they find those bank robbers ?
What about the sports page ? What were the scores of last night ’ s games ?
I would wondering if you like to stay here for a few days .
They ’ ll do the operation for you this Friday .
I think it ’ s important to do now . We can have a birthday party for you when you come out of the hospital .
I hate computer games .
Because they are too violent . Some of them are even disgusting .
If boys grow up with computer games , they will surely become bad .
Are you free this weekend , Miss Rose ?
Then would you please go to a dance party with me ?
Oh , no . As a matter of fact , I haven't danced for a long time .
Thanks for flattering me . I think you dance a lot , right ?
What's your favorite dance ?
How about rock'n'roll ?
And the tango ?
Don't be so modest . I'm sure you can do it very well . Then I'll meet you at six . Is that at all right ?
You are an outgoing person , quite easy to talk with .
Do you have many friends ?
What do you usually do with them ?
Doris , Helen Mall is having a big sale this weekend . Do you wanna go ?
Well , we can still do some window shopping , can we ?
I feel like going for a drink , it's been a long day .
How about the new bar across the road ?
I agree , I had lunch there last week .
Hello , are you Chinese ?
I'm from America . Are you settling in all right ?
I live in my uncle's house . He came here ten years ago .
I think it's just a matter of getting used to it .
Why don't you watch where you're going ?
There was plenty of room for me to pull out.You didn't have to stay in the lane you were in .
I think my arm is broken .
Listen , let's just wait until the police get here.Then we can decide whose fault this accident was .
I have a cell phone in my car . Now it's probably on the floor on the passenger side.Why don't you get it for me , and then I can call the police ?
It doesn't work . It looks like it's broken . I need to get to a hospital . You should drive me there .
Damn it ! I'm injured here . We could wait all day for the police .
It really hurts .
To hell with you . The accident was your fault .
Bill , do you know if the cafeteria around the corner's open today ?
Well , I thought that maybe we could go there for lunch today . That is , if you haven't promised to go with someone else .
I'm sorry I was such a grouch . It must've been the weather . When it rains I get depressed .
The stepmother was very wicked . She couldn't stand a happy smile on the boy's face .
And she did her best to pull out the thorn in her flesh and the boy lost whatever made him happy .
Sorry . I didn't mean to be late . Can I come in ?
Have I used the one that my sister is sick ?
Are you sure ? I thought I said it was my mother .
Well . You can trust me this time . My sister is definitely sick . I'm just coming from the hospital . They say she might even die .
I'll do my best .
Hi , Becky , what's up ?
What's the problem ?
For example ?
No , I can't see that happening . I know you're a good cook and nothing like that would ever happen .
Ella , it's been such a long week . I'm ready to go out and party . Hey , let's go out for a night on the town .
Let's go to the new club on West Street .
Hi , Alice , what are you doing this sunday ?
If you are free , maybe you would like to go to a small party and having for my birthday party . It will be fun , you will get to know lots of people .
Around six pm .
No . thank you . I can handle it , but thanks for the offer .
Hello.this is Susan .
Yes , I think So .
What ’ s the time ?
Oh , I ’ m sorry I can ’ t because I have to do some housework.You can ask Jenny to go with you
What is life ?
Then do you think that life is arranged by something above us .
David , I ’ m going to China .
You know . I took part in the Chinese contest . I was the best and they gave me this reward . I don ’ t have to pay for my trip .
Thank you . I ’ m leaving tomorrow morning .
I ’ m sure I will .
Did you watch the final last night ? My favorite singer won !
Yeah , he got booted after his initial performance in the audition , but he did not give up . He then tried at another two auditions .
Me too .
Yeah , there're so many excellent candidates out there . Who knows which one will make it to the final ?
He really did a great job in the finale , especially in the PK round . He performed so well that the majority of the audience cast their votes for him .
Come in , come in !
I thought we were supposed to meet here .
I ’ m sorry . We must have misunderstood each other .
You ’ re right . I am sorry . Let ’ s go and watch the movie .
Excuse me , i am a new student here . Could you tell me where the English Department is ?
Where is the school cafeteria ?
Where is the Computer Center ?
Where is the library ?
Thank you . I will go get one .
Well , hi ! My name is Eve Markowski . I am glad to meet you . With your friendly smile and helpful attitude . I am sure you will win .
You are welcome . I ’ d better go . Goodbye .
How about another beer ?
Stay around for a while.The party is warming up .
We have another traditional holiday-the Dragon Boat Festival .
It falls on the fifth day of the fifth lunar month .
OK . The Dragon Boat Festival is a way to commemorate a great ancient poet named Quyuan . On that day , people will hold a boat race as a symbol of the attempt to save him who threw himself into the river .
In order to prevent the fish from eating the poet's body .
Nice to see you , Patrick .
Yeah . All of us tried our best .
I think you're being a little naive .
That proves my point ! Protect yourself or you'll get burned .
Your knowledge of English is really surprising .
No , seriously . I am impressed .
Hello ?
I was just watching TV . What's going on with you ?
What did you watch ?
I remember that . It was a great movie . But it was definitely scary .
Sure . I can come over . What should we do ?
Ok . I'll get ready and leave . I'll see you in about 20 minutes .
Don't worry , nothings going to happen . I'll be there real soon .
are you a blogger ?
oh , it seems that I'm the only one who never blogs . When did you get started ?
what do you usually write about ?
that's interesting . How often do you write a blog ?
got it . Are you still updating your blog ?
Have you found a new job yet ?
What kind of work ?
What do you do there ?
How long is the assignment ?
This is just for you . Cheers ! Bottoms up .
I'm sorry , ladies . Mr . Smith's viewing is over . It ended an hour ago .
I'm afraid not . But at tomorrow's funeral , the family requested an open casket service .
I'm sorry . I know it must have come as a great shock .
I can ’ t bear it . The driver is too bad .
I prefer potatoes to eggplants .
But as a matter of fact , potatoes taste better .
That way they look longer .
Putting on mascara .
I won't .
Let's have some lunch ; do you know of a great restaurant somewhere ?
Maybe just a quick sandwich , salad , or something .
Can we walk there ?
Of course ! Let's go .
What are you going to do next year ?
Do you have any where in mind ?
Like a cat on hot bricks , as you might say . I don ’ t believe you are listening at all .
Don ’ t worry him , he has been grown up and I think he can take himself very well .
How long have you been in England ?
Almost two years ? Your English is very good .
The Johnson are on their way back.You remember them , don't you ?
We met them in Bermuda last May .
The couple with the dogs , think back .
Well , I've invited them for brunch .
His grandfather is the richest person in the area .
His grandfather's money is not his .
What did he say ?
It ’ s too good to be true ! If I were there , I would ask him if he himself was a successful man .
I wonder what he looks like . Oh , I can't wait to see him ! His email said he'd be wearing a white hat.oh , there he is .
Logan ! Why on earth are you hiding here ? White hat ! Come on ! Don't tell me you're the guy ! It can't be true .
what a bummer ! You set me up ?
We are just going round the corner for a drink . Won't you join us ?
Oh , come on ! Just a quick one !
Excuse me Miao Li . Could you tell me who Jackie Chan is ?
Ha , I know Cheng Long a lot , he has made 40 films since 1976 . And at that time he was promoted as the new Bruce Lee . But I'm not familiar with his English name .
Some movie stars measure their worth by how many millions of dollars they make . Do you know how Jackie Chan measures his worth ?
Sure . His skull , his eyes , his nose , three times , his jaw , his shoul-der , is chest , two fingers , a knee . As he said ' Everything from the top of my head to the bottom of my feet ! '
I'm sorry , but I can't find the book you lent me .
I must apologize . I'll buy you a new one tomorrow .
May I ask a question ?
What does mph stand for ?
Look , that bamboo groves are flourishing . Let's go and play there .
' Please don't enter the bamboo groves . ' We're not allowed to go in .
Are you ready to go shopping ?
What research ?
But they're just ads .
Is there anything worth watching on another channel ?
Do you mind if we watch it . I ’ d really like to see it .
Football game ? Ok , and you know what comes on next ?
Are you interested in watching it ?
Oh , I am sorry . What's on Channel 2 at 10 pm ?
Do you want to watch it ?
Well , how did you enjoy your seaside trip ?
Tell me about it , will you ?
Did you stop at the big waterfall for pictures ?
You were lucky then . What did you do after that ?
So you must have had a busy and enjoyable day yesterday .
Susan is going to get a divorce .
She told me that Peter and she has a quarrel last nigh , and she left this morning , bag and baggage .
Here's the course description guide .
Do you want me to help you ?
Look . Here are the core classes . Everyone has to take them .
You're catching on ! However , there are elective courses like wood shop , metal shop , home economics ...
Well , known , Jim , I'm ... I'm pretty much in favour of your computers , I think computers teach kids to think , because they require logical thoughts .
What do you mean ?
Ann , do you have time next Monday ?
Next Monday is my birthday , and I would like you to attend my party .
Great !
Five o ’ clock that afternoon , and in my place , you know ?
I am going to invite other guys . See you that day .
Hey Stacy . What's going on ?
Why ? You're not working so don't you have a lot of time on your hands ?
How about your husband . Does he help much ?
That sucks .
That's crossing the line .
Do you like watching the Winter Olympic Games ?
Of course I do . I love it . All the games are exciting and the competitors are respectable .
Yeah . What's the difference between the Winter Olympics and the Summer Olympics ?
I see . Then , what's your favorite winter sport ?
Then you must know Shen Due and Hao Hongbo .
How do you arrange this summer vacation ?
Where would you like to go ?
That's really a good idea . Taking a walk on the beach and lying in the sun are pretty good . I recommend you Qingdao or Dalian .
Yes , that's a good place to spend a holiday . Last year I went there . It's really .
Would you care for something to drink , Mr . Stone ?
I'm dreadfully sorry for you .
Is there any clue ?
Very glad to know something about you , then what are you going to do when you finish .
That ’ s a good idea . It must be easy to find a job in shanghai .
And English is very useful in your job .
You will be a very promising one .
I hear you are expecting your family .
I didn't know you had a brother .
Oh , nice . Is he coming on his own or with the family ?
Does your brother have just one son ?
I'm sure your parents are looking forward to seeing their grandson .
So when are they all coming ?
You seem to very busy these days . What are you doing ?
Where did you spend your holiday ?
So , Paula , where are you from ?
From Canada ? Where were you born ?
When did you come to Los Angeles ?
Did you go to school here ?
Did you get a job right after graduation ?
When was that ?
I bet that was interesting . What did you do there ?
Do you consider yourself a good mother ?
How can you manage to do both ? I mean , it is so hard to be a working mother .
Does your husband feel the same ?
I find it really hard to express myself in class . I have lots of ideas , but they never seem to come out of my mouth .
I often do , but I ’ m worried about the responses from other people .
I ’ m worried that what I say will not make sense .
that ’ s a good idea . What should I do if I am in two minds about a topic ?
I didn ’ t realize that speaking in class could be so easy .
What's his job ?
But Mrs.Smith hired him to find her lost son .
Bother the flies !
I don't know . Something rotten here ?
Have you got your invitation yet ?
The house warming party .
Tom and Bill Smith . They are both working now you know ? And they've bought a new house .
It's out in the suburbs .
Yes , I have . I went out with them last weekend .
Yes , it is . There are three bedrooms , a living room , a dining room , and a big kitchen .
Well , that does sound nice . Have they moved in yet ?
When are they going to have the party ?
hi , darling ! I have a one-month vacation saved up . How about a trip to Europe ?
oh , but I really need to leave this town for a change . Working day after day has worn me out . Do you have any other suggestions ?
wonderful ! I think that's a great idea . How soon until we can make this happen ? I can't wait !
perfect . I'll start preparing tomorrow . If we're going to drive , I'll need to fill up the tank .
we can take the train , that will be faster . I'll book the tickets tomorrow morning .
no problem . I'm really looking forward to the coming week .
Hi , Kenny . Let's go for a drink .
Somewhere new . It's a great place to pick up chicks .
Yeah , I broke up with Lisa.She blew a gasket over it . Whoa , get a load of that !
Never mind the getup.She ' s beautiful !
I'm gonna introduce myself .
Oh , oh , that tears it ! I'm getting out of here .
My ex-girlfriend's here.If she sees me , my goose is cooked .
Valerie ! Hi ! Wow how are you ? It ’ s been such a long time !
Really ? Thanks ! I went to that hair salon that you told me about , but enough about me ! Look at you ! You haven ’ t aged a day since the last time I saw you ! What is your secret !
Yes , my little Paul is finally a doctor . They grow up so fast you know .
Thank you ! What about your daughter , Pamela ? I heard she has passed the bar exam and married recently .
Such a lovely girl . I hope my Paul is lucky enough to find a girl like that someday !
Same here ! We will catch up soon , maybe over coffee !
Did you already take the history exam ?
I take it tomorrow morning . There is so much material that I dont know what to emphasize on . What types of questions did you get ?
What about Abraham Lincoln ? Did you get any questions about him ?
Hopefully he will use the same exam , cause Im going to spend most of my time studying the civil war . It is a huge section and that is what he lectured the most on in class .
Aright . Thanks for the info . I gotta go to the library now .
What's the matter with you , then ? You look miserable .
What do you mean by " us " ?
What do you mean ? We ' re talking now , aren't we ?
Yes . I remember . But we never used to argue . You used to think I was wonderful . Where are you going ?
Hey , Blake ! Are you still listening to Mozart ?
It's great . and I ' Ve heard that listening to Mozart can make you more intelligent .
Is classical music your favorite ?
I Like pop music best . Classical music is a bit too heavy for me . I can't get fully relaxed in it .
Yeah , that's why I can enjoy myself in it .
I think so , since I was in primary school . How long have you been interested in classical music .
oh , I didn't know you can play the violin . Do you still play .
It was really hard for our parents to save money when they were young .
Yeah . They simply had no extra money to save up or for other things .
Jane , I was wondering if you you had any plans for saturday afternoon .
There is a special exhibition of french sculptures at the museum , I was hoping you ' d like to come with me .
What about sunday ?
Maybe next week .
Sorry to hear that , I was really looking forward to spending some more time with you , I really enjoyed our last chat .
Have any plans for the weekend , Tom ?
Oh , do you go hiking often ?
It would be nice to get out of the city . Do you want some company ?
Yeah , I go a lot too . I saw a bear and a mountain lion on my last hike .
Yeah , my friend and I hiked in a very wild part of the national forest .
How upsetting ! He has been away for a week !
I have reported it to the police .
You've heard of Bruce Jenner , haven't you ?
I read that he trained so much that he used to dream about jumping hurdles .
Sometimes he would wake up covered in sweat , with his legs pumping away .
Mike ! Look at the floor !
What's wrong with it ? It's filthy !
It's filthy because you never wipe your shoes .
What are you looking for now ?
Well , they ' re not here.They are in the dustbin .
Excuse me . Do you study Chinese at this university ?
It takes a long time to learn Chinese writing .
Yes , I am . I am from Guangzhou . I am here to study international relations .
I like it so far . But my English still needs work .
Hey , look over there . It seems that there is something interesting going on . Let's go and have a look .
Look at that . It's so dangerous . My mom would never allow me to do that .
You are right . But what if an avalanche happened ?
Anyway , the show is breathtaking . By the way , where did they get so much snow here ?
Do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution ?
You'll never guess what I won at work today ! - Tickets to tonight's final NBA game .
Of course ! And here's the best part , they are court side seats !
Some guy in the accounting department has a brother on the team !
The game starts at seven so we'd better hustle , it's already five .
Let ’ s play a game !
No , no , a friend of mine taught me this really fun game . I ’ m going to describe someone ’ s face , and you guess who it is !
Let ’ s see . He has a roman nose , bushy eyebrows and dimples !
Aunt Rose ! That mole is so huge ! OK , my turn . He has a crooked nose and full lips . He has quite a few freckles and an oval face . Oh , he is also bald !
As we know , mobile phones bring people great convenience and shorten the distance among friends and relatives .
Is it ? I've never thought of any disadvantages of the mobile phone .
That's true . Some people pay too much attention to their mobile phones .
Lee , I'm going to get married next month .
You are invited to my wedding .
Thank you for lending me the book .
Don ’ t you agree that all the thieves should be punished by cutting off their fingers ?
Don ’ t you think in that case , there wouldn ’ t be so much stealing ?
The bartender just gave the last call . Let's order another round , okay ?
That sounds good . You order the beer while I go to the bathroom . Where is the can in this place ?
Yeah . I think I can find it .
That's because I just took one step inside and turned right around . That bathroom is too gross for me .
Let's leave then . I could take some fresh air , anyway .
hi , Mary ! What do you like to do in your spare time ?
what a confidence ! I always watch a lot of movies , too .
actually , I watch whichever movie there is , be it a comedy , a sci-fi or a suspense movie . How about you ?
really impressive . These two genres are totally different .
how often do you go to the cinema ?
movie salon ? where is that ?
is it good ?
really ? Maybe I shall also sign up for its membership .
Hey Suzie . Guess what ? I'm having a baby !
Thanks . I'm so excited . We've been trying for 8 months now .
Three months .
I want to , but Bob doesn't . He wants to be surprised like the old fashioned way .
I'd rather know and buy all the baby things ahead of time .
I know I am going to be busy , but I know I can handle it . I have been looking forward to this day for a long long time .
Mary seems depressed . What ’ s the matter ?
Believe it or not , one of the narrowest street in the world is only 49cm wide .
That's what I'm wondering , too .
Would you care to join for the picnic tomorrow ?
We'd like to invite you for our dress party tomorrow evening , are you free ?
What a pity ! You can't join us .
I'd like to invite you to dinner tonight , do you think have time ?
Which kind of food do you like , chinese food , western food or sea food ?
ok . I'll pick up your hotel at 6 thirty pm .
See you later .
Look ! I bought these shoes only three weeks ago and there is a hole in them already .
I did . But they said they won ’ t change them .
Do you sometimes feel overwhelmed by your work ?
Totally agree . What is your solution ?
You seem to have a very relaxed outlook .
But I don ’ t think we can change our working condition . Anyway , we are not the bosses .
I am so busy today .
I ’ m not sure . Perhaps you could do the shopping .
Or maybe make the beds .
Thanks . That ’ s terrific !
The restaurant across the street hired a new Chinese chef , so I ordered some Chinese food there for this evening .
Something hot and spicy . They look very inviting on the menu . You are going to love them .
I'm not sure . I don't enjoy cooking that much . As long as we can order it from a restaurant , we don't have to learn to do it by ourselves .
You don't look too well . Maybe you should take the day off from work .
Do you feel ok ?
Why don't you call your secretary and tell her to reschedule the meeting ? You should really get some rest or you'll end up feeling even worse than you do now .
You're really hot . Let me get you some Tylenol to bring the fever down .
Zach , what's that on your arm ?
It looks like you have a red rash all over you ! Are you allergic to anything ?
I completely forgot about your cat allergy . I took care of a cat for my friend here a few days ago . Oh no . we'd better go to the doctor and get some medicine . Let's go .
We would , but let's just go and see if there's an opening now before it gets worse .
I can't go to your party .
Do you like being a doctor ?
Can you tell me about it ?
What can you do when this happens ?
Have you eaten ?
It's too hot to read .
Which season do you like best ?
How about summer ?
Why ?
My son came home from three years in the navy .
John , my father isn't there at all . Are you kidding ?
It's ... oh it's the 1st April , April Fool's Day .
I must be going .
Hi , I made a reservation for a mid-size vehicle . The name is Jimmy Fox .
I don ’ t understand , I made a reservation , do you have my reservation ?
But the reservation keeps the car here . That ’ s why you have the reservation .
I don ’ t think you do.If you did , I ’ d have a car.See , you know how to take the reservation , you just don ’ t know how to hold the reservation and that ’ s really the most important part of the reservation , the holding . Anybody can just take them .
Fine . I ’ ll take the compact .
Do you think Tom will be elected president ?
Let's make a bet on who gets it .
I met a girl in elevator this morning . She works in a company upstairs . She said she envied the casual way we dress for work . She complained about the dress rule in her company . It requires everyone to wear formal clothes from Monday to Friday .
You know , in a sense , a suits and ties are compulsory for male employees even in July , and no jewelry allowed for most of the female employees . Even the reasonable male leaf is returning the rule , isn ’ t that strict ?
What happened ? Why didn't he win ?
How did that happen ? He's so talented ! I thought he had a great chance of winning a gold medal !
What ? What kind of drugs was he using ?
I thought that all athletes were supposed to be regularly tested for drugs .
That's so disappointing . I don't know why top athletes would feel the need to take drugs .
Regardless of how much pressure you're under , there's never a good reason to take drugs .
Cindy , how come nearly all the prime-time TV shows are comedies ?
Sitcoms ?
In Taiwan , prime-time shows are an hour long and most of them aren't comedies .
Are you interested in history ?
I love history , but I ’ Ve always thought that learning the reasons behind events is more important than remembering exactly when they happened .
Some people say that history repeats itself .
The idea is that the people and dates change , but the reason why things happen stay the same .
You're looking great .
What's the matter , John ? you seemed to be restless today .
Oh , that's easy . If it's better than the one you are doing now , go for it . That's my advice .
Then what about the salary ? Would you get more ?
Have you discussed it with your wife ?
As I say it the work is well worth try . After all you can get a higher salary .
Sybil . Is that spelt with an I or a Y ?
I see Mike farmer has make it into the Olympic team . He beat the national record by 0.1 of a second .
I think you ’ re right . I think we have a very good athletics team . They should do well in the Olympics . How many medals do you think we ’ ll win ?
What do you think our chance are in other events .
We might get a gold medal in the sailing too . Our team put in a lot of practice .
Helen , did you hear I ’ m having a party ? Next Saturday in my place .
Well , drop by if you can .
It's said that John's broken up .
I hear that John's leading a double wife .
Let's play chess .
That's all right , I'm a beginner . I've just learnt how to play .
You're a very good player
So did I . I won a prize last week but it was a prize for beginners .
You have been here for how long ? Four months now ?
Do you know Chinese better now ?
Oh , yeah . Many Chinese like to bargain . It happens almost everywhere .
A shouting match ? You ’ re so funny . You must be exaggerating . I don ’ t believe it .
Yes , perhaps . Chinese usually don ’ t notice that sort of thing . Maybe it ’ s quite natural to us .
Excuse me , can you tell me the name of the book you read ?
Harry Potter ? Is that book funny ?
Got it .
No , but my little brother likes it very much .
I'll try to read it . Actually , I like literature very much .
Jane Austen .
Oh , it's getting late . I've got to run . It was nice talking to you , karren .
I guess we'll see just around .
Hey Sandra , what's wrong ? You look furious !
But Sandra ... you love your job ! You spent months trying to get this position . It's perfect for you !
What kind of power struggles are you talking about ?
So he talks about you behind your back ?
I had a worker like that once . She was always taking credit for my ideas .
Doris , I'm glad you're home . I'm terrified . I don't know what to do !
I think someone is stalking me .
I don't know . I saw him the first time Tuesday . He was at the cafe . I noticed he was looking at me a lot . Not just the usual looking , but staring.He just kept staring at me . He didn't stop .
I didn't do anything . Finally , he left.But then I saw him again today . Outside the shoe store . Near the cafe . I went into a CD store and pretended I was looking at CD's . But then he came in too .
Yes . Then I noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me . He was following me .
Man , I'm hungry . Do you know a good place to have lunch ?
Mexican , Japanese or Chinese would be great .
Is it close by ?
OK , I'd love the company .
have you ever been to Disneyworld ?
the one in Florida is Disneyworld and the one in California is Disneyland , so you must have been to Disneyland .
well , I've never been to either so I was thinking of going to Disneyworld for my honeymoon .
some time next year . We haven't set the date yet .
thank you . So what do you think ? Would we have a good time ?
for the most part , yes . Some of the rides are bit too scary for me , though .
even the roller coasters that go through tunnels in the dark ?
thanks for the advice . I'll talk to my fiance about it tonight .
Matthew ? Hi !
It's got to be almost a year now .
I'm pretty good . I've been looking for a place to live recently . My lease runs out next month and I don't want to renew it .
Not yet . But I am still looking through the classifieds . Wish me luck .
Mrs . Thou ?
Great . It's a lovely neighborhood . And it would be nice to be neighbors again . It would be just like the old days !
Are you ready to go to the mall ?
Copycat !
You went out and bought khakis , too !
Have heard of Paul ?
He's got a promotion .
No , they made him vicepresident in charge of sells .
Well , it's true.The board man last thirdly and they choice Paul .
Jeff , I'm going to the supermarket . Do you want to come with me ?
Oh , When does it close ?
That's too bad .
Alright . What do you want to do now ?
Where does she live ?
How long has she lived there ?
That's a long time . Where did she live before that ?
Hey , Peter , have you had lunch yet ?
Who's that ?
I had a big argument with david yesterday . I hope he ’ s not still mad at me .
He borrowed some money from me and I needed it back . He said he didn ’ t have the money yet .
Yes , but I got angry with him too quickly . He probably thought that I mistrusted him . I shouldn ’ t have got angry .
Not much . I had to pay an unexpected bill , so I needed the money back .
No , we didn ’ t . I guess you ’ re right . We should patch things up .
Did you read the letter in the paper about smoking ? The person who wrote that must be crazy .
Maybe so . But a law banning cigarettes will do no good .
Do you know that the dolphin is the most intelligent animal in the world ?
They must be amazing animals .
I read that story too . They seem to be able to understand men .
Oh dear , my weight has gone up again .
And I suppose sitting at the desk all day in the office doesn't help .
I do wish I could lose weight .
I've tried diets before but they've never worked .
Could you please wait for a minute ? I'll buy the tickets
Here is your ticket .
The park will close soon . We Should better go in right now .
Yes , let's go in .
Yes , how do you know ?
Well , generally speaking , the park is a window on the world history , a window on the world civilization and a window on the world's tourist attractions as well .
I was just watching a documentary on TV about how people use dogs for various purpose . It was very interesting .
The documentary also pointed out that they are used by shepherds to round up sheep and by rescue workers to find people trapped under rubble or snow .
Don ’ t forget that horses are still used in many countries to pull ploughs and carts .
Yes , I can . I don ’ t ride regularly though . How about you ?
Where's Mrs . Johnson ?
I see . Can I sit down ?
Thank you , Mr . Johnson .
Okay , Tom .
She's upstairs in my room .
Have you heard of Paul ?
He's got a promotion .
No , they made him vicepresident in charge of sells .
Well , it's true . The board man last thirdly and they choice Paul .
Let's speed up . We're going to be late again .
Is it your first time to join the sports meeting of Junior High School ?
Long-distance race , dash , hurdle race , relay race , standing long jump , high jump , shotput and so on .
OK , let's go .
Wonderful , Bruce is taking the lead .
Come on , Bruce . Come on , Bruce .
Tim ’ s smiles are interesting .
You are right . They sweep Nancy off her feet . And now she fell head over heels in love with him .
Have you enjoyed your weekend ?
The Great Wall is a great attraction for visitors .
Someone claimed it was one of the two man-made wonders that could be seen on the moon .
I ’ m forming a music band .
Uh ... Yeah ! I ’ Ve told you a thousand times that I ’ m learning to play the drums . Now that I know how to play well , I would like to form a rock band .
We have a guy who plays guitar , and another who plays bass . Although we still haven ’ t found anyone to be our singer . You told me that you had some musical talent , right ?
Perfect . So you can audition this weekend here at my house .
What would you like for Christmas ?
Have you asked Santa ?
Lili , let ’ s take a vacation !
Well , Lili , we can visit different places in the state in our van 10 . We are not going to take a plane or stay at a hotel this time . Trust me , it won ’ t cost much .
In the van .
Let ’ s see . Gas , food , recreation , we won ’ t spend much . Come on . Don ’ t hesitate . We need to get out of the house once in a while . We have been working hard , haven ’ t we ?
The sooner the better ! I can ’ t wait !
As long as we ’ re going , you can decide where to go . I trust your judgments . I know you miss Chinese food , so we can eat at a Chinese restaurant this time .
What date will our field trip be on ?
Yes , I will make note of that .
I will be there half an hour early .
Yes , someone is picking me up .
Not at the moment — maybe later , though .
The acting of this film is marvelous in spite of the thin plot .
I don't think there's any excuse for his acting in some parts .
How was your business trip ?
Nice to meet you here.How come you dropped into this company today ?
Two years or so .
No , in most cases I don't have to unless there is something urgent to deal with . I work five days a week .
It is hard to say.But I've to start by working as a trainee before I really become an experienced marketing assistant.Sometimes , I am really under great pressure when it gets busy .
Luckily not.The silent I meet are generally very friendly and have a good boss .
Scientists have found a second solar system in the universe .
It's just a system like ours , with a star and a number of planets going around it .
It's exciting news ! If we find a second solar system , we might find a second earth !
Why didn't you tell me you had a girlfriend ?
But you should tell me you were in love with her .
You know you didn't .
Yes , but you might have told me before .
You can't be serious . How dare you not tell me you are going to marry her ?
How was the movie last night ?
Mary said that she was really pleased with the photography .
She liked the acting , too , because that's what she wanted to see .
Honey , I ’ ll be right back !
I told you already ! I ’ m going to get my nails done .
Well , first of all , I like to pamper myself , and my nails look great . You should come with me !
They don ’ t only paint my nails ! The manicurist will remove my cuticles , file my nails , and apply at least nails coats of nail polish !
Good afternoon !
I'm very well , thank you.How are you ?
Yes , it's beautiful , but it's also very hot .
What's the weather like in your country ?
Where do you live ?
I ’ Ve had it ! I ’ m done working for a company that is taking me nowhere !
That ’ s exactly what I am going to do ! I ’ Ve decided to create my own company ! I ’ m going to write up a business plan , get some investors and start working for myself !
Well , no , it can ’ t be that hard ! I mean , all you have to do is explain your business , how you are going to do things and that ’ s it , right ?
Well , that seems easy enough .
Geez . Is that all ?
I hear that Mary got mad .
What ’ s wrong with her ?
Um , what will you do this weekend ?
A movie ? Sure . Do you know what's on right now ?
What ’ s on TV tonight ?
Wait a second . I want to watch Ally McNeal .
No it ’ s not . It ’ s just funny .
Well , you just want to watch Dark Angel because of the hot girl .
It ’ s story is just an excuse to get the girl dressed up in different tight outfits .
It ’ s really terrible !
Don ’ t you see many parents are forcing there children ’ s hands to learn something they think important to their children . But the children are not interested in it at all .
Sarah , what did you do today ?
Did you buy anything ?
What did you buy ?
Yeah , I like it a lot . It's very pretty . Where did you buy it ?
Was it expensive ?
That's cheap .
Hi , Victor . How are you ?
So , are you going to go to class tonight ?
Really ? What's the matter ?
Listen . Come with me to class , and after class we can go out for dinner .
How's John doing ?
The Phoenix team overpowered its counterpart 86 to 50 .
If the Phoenix beats the Rocket , it will enter the final .
What's that book you have under your arm ?
How in the world did you get a copy ? I've put a hold on it at the public library for weeks and I'm still waiting my turn .
Is it really worth paying for ?
Come on , you are left behind !
You just need more exercise .
I don't care . I want to burn up my fat .
Why ?
But I want to burn up more calories !
Hello , Daisy , how are you doing ?
I have been spending a lot of time watching movies at home , so you wouldn't have seen me . Recently , I've been obsessed with horror films .
Yeah , you are right I used to not watch horror films , but after seeing Silence of the Lamb with Mike last month , I fell in love with them .
But it's really exciting .
Basically . you'll watch any type of movie except horror .
I think you should have a try someday . Maybe you'll change your mind .
It's hard to be optimistic about things with the way the economy's headed ... The trade deficit is getting larger , consumption's down , I really think we're headed for a recession .
Increasing exports would weaken the currency . I think the main point is economic growth . We need more jobs . Factories have outsourced and moved many jobs to foreign countries . The result is an increase in unemployment in our own country , lower consumption , lower production , and an overall feeble economy . If more people are working , it will give the economy a boost .
Are you an art aficionado ?
I love going to art galleries , particularly when one is holding an exhibition of abstract art .
Art isn ’ t for everyone . I ’ m going to an exhibition tomorrow at the national gallery . It ’ s an exhibition of greek and roman sculpture .
I thought I ’ d have an early lunch and go immediately afterwards . Does that sound ok to you ? Bus 51 goes directly there .
What does your mother do , may I ask ?
Is she busy ?
Hello , Bessie .
My birthday ? I forgot it , Thank you for remembering my birthday .
Thanks a lot . I'm so touched .
Nice day , isn't it ?
Why don't you sit down and relax , darling ?
Well , come over and talk to me then .
May I turn on the TV then ?
So that we can sit down together and listen to some music .
I will , but let's go to the disco after dinner .
Diane Grant ? I haven't seen you for ages !
Pretty good . Say , you've really changed !
Well , you look great ! How are you ?
How is your new dormitory ?
Well , do you all major in the same subject ?
Peter , how often do you exercise ?
Now , tell me , what do you eat ?
Do you eat a lot of vegetables ?
What do you drink ?
What ’ s the Mountaineering Club doing this weekend ?
How hard is the climb ?
What did you do last week ?
Wow ! That sounds like a lot of fun . I ’ m sorry I missed it .
Yeah , I will . See you then !
How many languages can you speak ?
How well can you speak them ?
Can you help me to translate these sentences into German now ?
Gross ! What are you doing to yourself ?
It looks like some kind of primitive form of torture .
Well , you might pinch your eyelid ! Or lose an eyeball !
Do you really have to work today ?
But you'll miss out on the football game .
How smart of you to book the tickets before hand !
Of course , otherwise you ’ ll just have to wait for hours .
I had an accident .
I found a new job after all , and I like this one even better than the last .
Tom , I won first prize in the poetry contest .
Really ! Here's my trophy .
What a beautiful watch . It goes very well with your ring .
Is that your wedding ring ?
Well , congratulations . When is the big date ?
Did you have the watch before getting the ring ?
You did a fabulous job with the selection . It's gorgeous .
What kind of watch is it ?
If you don't mind me asking , how much do they cost ?
That's why it looks so nice . I should have figured . You always get what you pay for .
I'm really mad at Bob .
Hi , Jack , how have you been ?
Why ? Looks like you're feeling very down ! What happened ?
Come on . For a man who's feeling so , down , there're usually two reasons . Either his career is going downhill , or he has a broken heart . Since you're so successful , it must be the latter .
Oh , I'm sorry . I thought you two were made for each ocher .
Well , she is not to blame . It's always difficult to choose between career and family .
Jack , I don't know what to say to comfort you , but cheer up ! There are plenty of fish in the sea and you'll find your soul mate , your perfect match !
Do you know Sally ?
Why is she still single ? She must have a face that would stop clock .
Excuse me . Do you have the time ?
Is it ? Oh , no . The concert will begin in twenty minutes . Are we too late to get there ?
Did you watch the volleyball match last night ?
Who won ?
What is the score ?
What do you mean ? If he was a good programmer , he should have been raking it in .
Again ?
Ouch .
You mustn't touch the wet paint , Bill .
Try to be more careful in future . Look ! you've damaged the sign .
Good morning . I ’ m from the New York book review . Could I ask you some questions about your latest book ?
First , I ’ Ve heard that your latest book is based on a true story .
How do you research your books ?
I really like your books . I ’ Ve just finished this one . I read it from cover to cover in a single day . Congratulation on making the bestseller list yet again !
Oh ! Thank you very much . I heard that you are currently writing a collection of short stories . What are the stories about ?
What shall I call him ?
What's he doing ?
For the 100th anniversary of the opening of the library we are going to have a party .
I hoped you would be willing to brainstorm with me for party ideas .
Perfect . It will be open to the public and we anticipate roughly about five to seven hundred people .
Yes . And we checked with the city and we have permission to use the park adjacent to the library .
I'm so glad I bought this watch !
I think this is the coolest watch I've ever owned .
Isn't that a silly question ? You know how much of an athlete I am .
Do you take a bus to and from work ?
Hmm . I have the same problem . When I leave work , it ’ s always rush hour . So the buses are always crowded .
That sounds terrible the way you describe it . But you know , not long ago I really suffered on the bus .
You just can ’ t imagine ! I waited for the first bus but it was too full , so I waited for the second , and it was still very crowded . Then I decided not to wait for the next one , and got on the second bus . It was so full that I had to stand on one foot ! No kidding !
Yeah , absolutely !
You were so happy , weren ’ t you ?
We are going to have a picnic tomorrow at the picnic center .
Now let's get things ready .
Look ! Mom , that's amazing ! I can't believe the girls have so neat movements .
And all their movements are so elegant . It seems like dancing in the water .
There you go ! Daddy has told me that water ballet is also called Synchronized Swimming .
Wow , Mom is more knowledgeable than Dad . I must learn from you .
OK , you're the boss . Look , Mom , one guy has just jumped into the swimming pool .
It seems that nobody in your class likes Paul .
As a teacher , I don ’ t know how to help him .
Hey Rachael , what's up ? How is your day ?
Oh , yea . I forgot.So how did it go ?
Great , so what happens now ?
Do you believe in UFOs ?
But I never saw them .
You mean that you can them .
They come to the earth ?
Aliens from the outer space ? Do you talk to them ? What do they look like ?
That means that you talk to them ? In which language ?
You look so happy , Anna . Any good news ?
Really ? Congratulations !
By the way , would you like to have dinner with me tomorrow evening ? Tomorrow is my birthday .
Not so soon . It ’ s not my birthday today . Well , you ’ ll come , won ’ t you ?
Do you have a minute ?
Hey , May , look , Is that the the poster of the movie we saw yesterday ?
May , I really regret watching it with you last night .
Of course not . I just thought the movie was ... boring .
Well , I admit . The ghosts were scary .
That's Gucci's influence . I love science fiction movies !
Don't call me kid . I am a grownup .
Of course ! I can watch them without you !
What is your nationality ?
Where is your domicile place ?
I know you have a son . How old is he ?
Who is looking after him ?
You really are lucky !
Say , what's your favorite sport ?
Do you play much tennis ?
So Janet , do you do any sports ?
Yeah , how often do you go ?
Not bad ! Do you do any other sports ?
Hello , Ken .
Have you just been to the cinema ?
What ’ s on ?
Oh , I ’ Ve already seen it . I saw it on television last year . It ’ s an old film , but it ’ s very good .
Yes , I have . I was there in April .
It was spring , but the weather was awful . It rained all the time .
They got a divorce at last .
You said it . Love but on the sand will soon be on the rocks .
Where are you going ?
What's wrong with her .
Congratulations to you .
I can ’ t stand being with you anymore . I'm sick of your drinking .
How many chances have I given you ? I don ’ t trust you any more .
Are there any interesting stories in the newspaper today ?
Was it caused accidentally or naturally ? Sometimes it gets so hot that fires begin naturally in Australia and Africa .
What is the international community doing to help ?
How many countries have been affected ?
I saw on the tv yesterday that there has been another earthquake in iran .
Does the newspaper say anything about casualties ?
Is this a photo of your family ?
You look so lovely .
I heard you've found a new job .
So you're quite happy with your new job ?
Would you come to spend the weekend with us ?
That ’ s too bad .
You received a letter in the mail .
Who ’ s the letter from ?
I want to know what it says .
Are you serious ?
Are you okay ?
I am really sorry to hear that .
Why are you so quiet ?
You must feel terrible now .
I remember my first break up . It was the worst feeling in the world . I was crying everyday for three months . And slowly , it got better . I know you'll feel better too .
Yeah . I remember it very clearly . The pain makes it easy to remember . I know you're really hurting right now , but you know many people experience break ups .
I know it's painful , but it's only temporary . After the pain goes away , you'll find other girls .
You'll change your mind . Look at everyone in the world . They all break up and move on . The faster you understand this , the quicker you will recover .
I also know you must still have strong feelings for her , but try to think of all the bad things . You know she didn't treat you that well . Is that the person you want to spend the rest of your life with ?
I'll give you a call later . We should hang out . It's good to be around people .
Excuse me , what do you want for this bag ?
Would you take $ 12 ?
13.50 ?
I ’ m afraid I spoke in all of the table clock .
I ’ m terribly sorry , Won ’ t you let me pay for ?
A :: Mr Clinton , it's nice to see you again .
A :: Very well . How's Mrs Clinton ?
Whatever we do , we should do it above board .
Morning , Zina . Just wanted to say thanks again !
Oh , yeah . I'm glad you mentioned that . I think we need to hire somebody new to manage it .
This is the best dinner I've ever had .
I've never tasted anything better .
Hey Nick , what are you up to ?
Seriously ? You mean to fire a real weapon ? I don ’ t know man .
Yeah that would be cool ! Maybe I can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun ! Maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti tank missile ! Or what about a flame thrower !
Wow , I didn ’ t know ! It always looks so cool and easy in the movies !
Hi , Jim . How are you ? I haven ’ t seen you for a while .
Where were you ?
Broadway Mall is having a big sale this weekend . You wanna go ?
Well , we can still do some window shopping , can't we ?
What's the problem , Nada ? You look down in the dumps .
come on , nothing can be that bad .
ok , I promise . So what's troubling you so much ?
really ? Is he married ?
then what's your problem ?
oh , I see . Office romance tends to be the subject of gossip .
office romance is very tricky .
You're not looking happy . What's the matter ?
With the job ?
A good suggestion for you . You need a holiday .
What do you mean ?
You need a holiday . That's what's the matter .
I wonder what he looks like . Oh , I can't wait to see him ! His email said he'd be wearing a white hat . ( looking around for him ) oh , there is .
Logan ! Why on earth are you hiding here ? White hat ! Come on ! Don't tell me you're the guy ! It can't be true .
What a bummer ! You set me up ?
How dare you ! ( starts to walk off )
Why did you lie to me in the email ?
I should have known it was you . No wonder all the 20 questions were answered correctly . I thought I might have found the one for me .
Peter , how often do you exercise ?
Now , tell me , what do you eat ?
Do you eat a lot of vegetables ?
What do you drink ?
Did you watch the volleyball match last night ?
Who won ?
What was the score ?
Even if our company didn't have a dress code , I still think people would wear formal clothing to work .
Maybe that's true for some positions , but I think the marketing and sales staff would definitely not agree . They dress for success ! You can't go out on a sales call if you are dressed in jeans . It's just not respectful to you client .
It's not as simple as that . People judge you by your appearance , whether you like it or not . So dressing professional is being professional . The image that you portray to others is so important in business . It's your image and how others perceive you that makes the difference between landing or losing a sale .
Isn't it wonderful walking here ?
I mean look at all these magnificent buildings around us .
It's quite famous but don't you think it looks a bit old-fashioned ?
What other important buildings are we going to see on Fifth Avenue ?
What's there after that ?
What are they all for ?
Hey Kevin , what are you doing here ? Don't you usually spend Tuesday nights at home studying ?
What did she tell them ? Is she dropping out of college ?
And your parents took it badly ?
Ouch , that sounds bad . What did your sister do ?
How long has your sister been with her boyfriend ?
Really ? Then I guess living together would be a good idea .
Well , these days too many people are getting divorced . If they live together , then at least they're finding out if they're really compatible or not .
Do you think they two will get married ?
I think so . Yes , they get along so well .
What do you think of Frank ?
Why do you say that ?
Uh-oh . We don't have a flashlight .
Do you speak only English in the class , or does your teacher explain everything to you in Spanish ?
I suppose she's right . Does she speak English very slowly ?
It must be interesting to study English .
Is English pronunciation easy or difficult ?
It's quiet everywhere in winter .
Me too .
That's a good idea . Let's go !
Take care ! Don't slip on the ground .
Yes . Very wonderful .
Tim's always bothering me .
Who are those guys ?
Oh .
All right !
Wow , Michael Jordan ’ s slam-dunks are beautiful things to watch .
Which team do you think will win ?
I am sorry to trouble you again , Mr.Stone .
Where should I go after I arrived at the university ?
Why ?
What kind of role do foreign student advisers play ?
Can we get any more help at the International Center ?
I see . It must be worth going to .
Wonderful . It is a home for foreign students .
hi , Lander . What's wrong ?
same here . I have't brought any new clothes for three months .
true . The news says that there is a general increase in the price of daily necessities .
the biggest price jump is for pork , so most people have to turn to chicken .
inflation is more than just the rising prices , I guess . But the central bank is warning about the risk of inflation .
yes . The government has banned price hikes in some key industries like energy .
you said it . I think we should tighten our budget and cut our spending .
for a start , we can take the public transport to work . You know , running a car is a big expense .
OK , everyone . Gather around . Here are the rules . No tackling . No pushing .
Play is stopped when the person with the ball is touched .
The touchdown lines are there and there . OK , let's play !
Have you adapted to the lifestyle in China ?
What ?
What is it ?
That makes you feel uncomfortable ?
Perhaps that's because we hold different ideas about privacy .
Well , that's not rare . I've seen people reading at others ' newspaper while taking a metro or a bus .
Yeah .
What courses did you take in college ?
Which course did you like best ?
Hi . Have you got a personal computer ?
I wonder if you often trade with others on the internet .
Great ! It's just like viewless stores . But how can you shop or order on line or trade on line ?
Is the service charged ?
We are planning to go to Beidaihe for vacation . Do you want to go with us ?
Excuse me , is this seat taken ?
Oh . is it . Thank you anyway .
I prefer potatoes to eggplants .
But as a matter of fact , potatoes taste better .
Are you sure you can't lend me five thousand dollars ?
Where do you plan to go this winter ?
Oh , yes , you like skiing .
Every time when heroes came back from the battlefield , we took our hats off to them .
Frank ’ s getting married , do you believe this ?
Yes , he is . He loves the girl very much .
A girl he met on holiday in Spain , I think .
OK . Come back into the classroom , class .
Yes , but to the heath , this break has long enough .
Come on , baby . It ’ s time now .
Do you have any hobbies ?
Oh , that ’ s interesting , and but what kind of things ?
Stones ? I know many people collecting coins and stamps but stones ?
Jenny , what's wrong with you ? Why do you keep weeping like that ?
What a nice day !
great , let's go !
exactly . You know , the sunshine and wind remind me of our honeymoon . You remember ? The island , the sound of the waves , the salty sea air and the sunshine ...
why not go again to celebrate out one-year anniversary ? We can go to the same beach , stay in the same hotel and enjoy a dinner in the same restaurant .
never mind that , I'll take care of it . Are you available next week ?
ok . I'll make the arrangements . It will be great .
